  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>This document describes how projects configured under FCM can be
  distributed externally. Particular attention is given to collaborative
  distributions - where the external user regularly returns code for
  consolidation into the central repositories which hold the master copies of
  the code.</p>

  <p><dfn>Note:</dfn> This document assumes that the repositories are
  inaccessible to the external user, due to issues of security and
  practicality.</p>

  <h2 id="distribution">Creating a Distribution</h2>

  <p>A system configured under FCM can be distributed by packaging a known
  revision (usually corresponding to a stable release) into an archive (e.g. a
  tarball) of directories and files. Various issues need to be considered:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A distribution may contain a variety of different files including
    source code, scripts, benchmark and validation tests, documentation,
    etc.</li>

    <li>A system may consist of several different <em>projects</em> which
    should be put into separate directories in the distribution. Please refer
    to the section <a href=
    "../user_guide/system_admin.html#svn_design">Repository design</a> in the
    FCM user guide for an explanation of what is meant by a project in this
    context.</li>

    <li>Some files in a project may not be included in the distribution. This
    may be because they are of no interest to external users or because of
    license restrictions. Such files will need to be filtered out when creating
    the distribution.</li>

    <li>The distribution may also contain some files which are not maintained
    under FCM version control (test results for instance).</li>

    <li>Some systems share code with other systems.

      <ul>
        <li>If a distribution is intended to be used standalone then the
        necessary files from these other systems will need to be included. e.g.
        The VAR system requires code from the OPS and GEN systems.</li>

        <li>If the distribution is part of a wider collaboration then it is
        likely that the files from the other systems will be distributed
        separately. It is best if stable releases of the various systems can be
        synchronised so that, for example, a VAR stable release uses code from
        an OPS stable release which both use code from the same GEN
        release.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Release notes should be prepared to accompany a distribution which
    explain, among other things, how the distribution is structured.</li>

    <li>The distribution should contain a file which identifies the repository
    revision(s) contained in the distribution.</li>

    <li>System managers will probably wish to maintain a script which automates
    the generation of these distributions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="feedback">Feeding Back Changes</h2>

  <p>Although we would encourage all collaborators to make use of the FCM
  system for version control, we recognise that they may already have their own
  preferred systems in place. There is no particular problem with this. The
  main requirement is that any proposed changes are provided as a modification
  relative to the provided distribution. The changeset could be provided in the
  form of a modified project tree or as a patchfile (refer to the later section
  <a href="#patchfiles">Exchanging Changesets using Patchfiles</a> for further
  discussion). If the change involves any renaming or removal of files or
  directories then special instructions should be provided plus a script to
  perform the changes.</p>

  <p>At the central repository, the changeset should be applied to a branch
  created from the repository revision which formed the basis of the changeset
  (possibly making use of the Subversion utility <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.vendorbr.html#svn.advanced.vendorbr.svn_load_dirs">
  svn_load_dirs.pl</a>). Note that extra care is needed with changesets
  provided as modified project trees if there are any files in the project
  which are excluded from the distribution. Once imported, the changeset should
  then undergo any necessary testing or review before being merged into the
  trunk.</p>

  <h2 id="usingfcm">Collaborating Using FCM for Version Control</h2>

  <p>There are a number of advantages if the FCM system is used for version
  control by the collaborator. In particular it means that:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Collaborators will be able to see all of the individual changesets
    which went in to a new release rather than only being able to view each new
    release as one big change.</li>

    <li>The process of sending a proposed change to the central repository can
    be standardised through the use of an <em>FCM patch</em> (explained
    later).</li>

    <li>The FCM Extract system can be fully utilised.</li>

    <li>Common tools will help to ease communication. We will all use technical
    terms to mean the same thing.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This section explains the recommended way of using FCM in a
  collaboration.</p>

  <h3 id="initsvn">Initialising the Subversion Repositories</h3>

  <p>The collaborator needs to set up a repository and import each of the
  projects. Please see the section <a href=
  "../user_guide/system_admin.html#svn_create">Creating a repository</a> in the
  FCM user guide for advice. Collaborators may wish to use separate
  repositories and Trac systems for each project or they may prefer to use a
  single repository for all projects and use a single Trac system. Either
  option should be fine so long as the same set of projects is retained.</p>

  <p>After completing the initial import, the collaborator should have the
  required set of projects available in Subversion where the initial version of
  the trunk of each project corresponds with the initial stable release
  provided in the distribution.</p>

  <h3 id="prepchanges">Preparing Changes at the Collaborator's Site</h3>

  <p>The recommended way of preparing changes is illustrated in Figure 1a:</p>

  <p><strong>Figure 1a: working at the collaborator's
  site</strong></p>

  <p><img src="working-as-collaborator.png" alt=
  "Figure 1a: working at the collaborator's site" class="img-polaroid" /></p>

  <p>The collaborator will create a shared package branch from the latest
  stable release on the trunk. This branch will contain all the changes that
  will eventually be fed back to the central repository. Developers will also
  create their own development branches. These may be branched from the latest
  stable release on the trunk. Alternatively, if the change needs to build on
  other changes then a branch can be created from the shared package branch.
  When the changes are ready (i.e. tested, documented, reviewed, etc) then they
  are merged into the shared package branch. The trunk is not used for the
  shared changes as it is reserved for changes received from the central
  repository.</p>

  <p>Should it be required, a second shared package branch can be created from
  the same point to contain any local modifications that will not be fed back
  to the central repository. A configuration branch can then be used to combine
  the local changes with those destined to be fed back. This is illustrated in
  Figure 1b:</p>

  <p><strong>Figure 1b: managing local changes</strong></p>

  <p ><img src="managing-local-changes.png" alt=
  "Figure 1b: managing local changes" class="img-polaroid" /></p>

  <h3 id="feedbackfcm">Feeding Back Changes Using FCM</h3>

  <p>Eventually, a series of changesets will exist on the first package branch.
  These changes will be fed back to the central repository via an <em>FCM
  patch</em>. This contains a series of differences associated with changesets
  in a given branch of development, created by the <code>fcm mkpatch</code>
  command. For further information about the command, please refer to its
  <a href="../user_guide/command_ref.html#fcm-mkpatch">command
  reference</a> in the FCM user guide.</p>

  <p>At the central repository, the changeset will be applied to a branch
  created from the repository revision which formed the basis of the changeset.
  This is illustrated in Figure 2:</p>

  <p><strong>Figure 2: feeding back changes</strong></p>
  <p><img src="feeding-back-patch.png" alt=
  "Figure 2: feeding back changes" class="img-polaroid" /></p>

  <p>Patches will usually be exchanged in the form of a tarball. To apply the
  patch it must first be extracted to a directory. In this directory there
  should be a shell script called <code>fcm-import-patch</code>. A TARGET needs
  to be specified when invoking the script. The TARGET must either be a URL or
  a working copy of a valid project tree that can accept the import of the
  patches. It is essential that this target matches the version of the project
  from which the patch was created (usually this means a particular stable
  release). The script contains a series of <code>cp</code> and
  <code>svn</code> commands to import the changesets one by one. Note that the
  changesets are committed automatically with no user interaction. It is worth
  ensuring that an up to date backup of the repository is available in case of
  problems.</p>

  <h3 id="changescentral">Incorporating Changes into the Trunk of the Central
  Repository</h3>

  <p>Once the changes have undergone any necessary testing or review they can
  be merged into the trunk. There are three ways of approaching this:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>As one changeset: all changes in the branch will be merged into the
    trunk as a single changeset. This approach is the easiest and has the
    advantage that any conflicts only need to be resolved once. However, the
    drawback of this approach is that the logical changesets as fed back by the
    collaborator will be combined into a large single changeset on the trunk,
    which may not be the most desirable (although the logical changesets will
    still be available to examine on the import branch). This is illustrated in
    Figure 3a:
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Figure 3a: merging a patch in a single changeset</strong></p>

  <p><img src="merging-patch-one.png" alt=
  "Figure 3a: merging a patch in a single changeset"
  class="img-polaroid" /></p>

  <ol start="2">
    <li>As multiple changesets: each changeset in the branch will be merged
    into the trunk in order. This can be quite complicated and time consuming,
    especially if you have a large number of changesets and there are a lot of
    clashes. The advantage is that each logical changeset will retain its
    logical identity, which may be more desirable in the long run, when you
    come to inspect the history. This is illustrated in Figure 3b:
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p><strong>Figure 3b: merging a patch in multiple changesets</strong></p>

  <p><img src="merging-patch-multi.png" alt=
  "Figure 3b: merging a patch in multiple changesets"
  class="img-polaroid" /></p>

  <ol start="3">
    <li>As a mixture of the above: you may want to combine the above two
    approaches when it makes sense to do so. For example, there may be a series
    of small changesets that can be combined logically, or there may be a
    changeset that fixes a bug introduced in the previous one. The bottom line
    is that the project/system manager should use his/her own judgement in the
    matter for what is best for the future of the project.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="changescollab">Incorporating Updates at the Collaborator's Site</h3>

  <p>Once a new stable release is available it will be supplied in the form of
  a distribution tarball as described earlier. However, collaborators will also
  be supplied with an <em>FCM patch</em> (as described earlier) for each
  project containing all the changes made since the previous stable release.
  Note that this assumes that stable releases are prepared on the trunk and not
  in branches.</p>

  <p>Each patch should be applied to the trunk of the collaborator's
  repository. This means that the collaborator's trunk will always be mirroring
  that of the central repository. This is illustrated in Figure 4:</p>

  <p><strong>Figure 4: mirroring the trunk at the
  collaborator's site</strong></p>

  <p><img src="mirroring-trunk.png" alt=
  "Figure 4: mirroring the trunk at the collaborator's site"
  class="img-polaroid"/></p>

  <p>In order to be certain that the patch has worked correctly, we recommend
  that a check is performed to ensure that the new stable release on the trunk
  matches the files provided in the distribution (preferably using a copy of
  the repository for testing purposes before applying the patch to the live
  repository).</p>

  <h3 id="updatebranches">Updating Existing Branches</h3>

  <p>Old branches that are still active at the collaborators site should be
  updated to the latest stable release when it becomes available. Developers
  should create a new branch from the latest stable release and then merge the
  changes from the old branch to the new branch. The old branch should be
  deleted once it is no longer required. This is illustrated in Figure 5a:</p>

  <p><strong>Figure 5a: updating a branch to the latest
  stable release</strong></p>

  <p><img src="updating-branch.png" alt=
  "Figure 5a: updating a branch to the latest stable release"
  class="img-polaroid"/></p>

  <p>Note that the merge will be easiest if the old branch was created from the
  previous stable release. If it was created from the shared package branch
  then a custom merge will be required to achieve the desired result (a normal
  FCM merge command would choose the wrong base for comparison). This is
  illustrated in Figure 5b:</p>

  <p><strong>Figure 5b: updating a branch of the shared package
  branch</strong></p>

  <p><img src="updating-shared-branch.png" alt=
  "Figure 5b: updating a branch of the shared package branch"
  class="img-polaroid"/></p>

  <h3 id="other">Other Scenarios</h3>

  <p>The previous sections have only considered how developments on the trunk
  of a central repository can be shared with a single collaborator. However,
  the same techniques can be applied to more complex situations.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If there are multiple external collaborators each working with their
    own repository then hopefully it is clear that this does not alter things
    in any way. Inevitably there will be an increased workload on the
    maintainers of the central repository. There will also be an increased need
    for coordination of planned code changes. However, the method of code
    exchange is unaltered.</li>

    <li>Sometimes there may be the need to collaborate on development of a
    branch (i.e. to exchange code which is not yet ready to be incorporated
    onto the trunk). The collaborator would maintain the trunk of their
    repository as before, importing patches to keep their trunk alligned with
    the stable releases from the central repository. In addition, they would
    receive an <em>FCM patch</em> from the central repository representing the
    changes on the shared branch relative to the stable release. The
    collaborator should create a branch from the stable release and the patch
    should then be imported onto this branch. They should then create a branch
    from this branch on which to prepare their changes. When ready the changes
    would be returned in the form of an <em>FCM patch</em>, and so on.
    Hopefully it can be seen that the same process can be applied to this
    shared branch as we have previously described for trunk developments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="alternative">An Alternative Branching Strategy</h3>

  <p>We have described the branching strategy we believe will work best for
  collaborators. However, this is by no means the only branching strategy that
  can be used. In particular, some collaborators may prefer to keep the latest
  copies of the code they are using on the trunk. This effectively means
  getting rid of the shared package branches for shared and local changes and
  merging all changes on to the trunk. A separate branch would be used for
  keeping a pristine copy of the main site and merging changes from new stable
  builds on to the trunk.</p>

  <p>This approach is certainly possible and has the advantage that developers
  at the collaborator's site may find it easier to work with. However there are
  two disadvantages that need to be considered:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Merging in changes from a new stable release may be more difficult. If
    the new stable release includes changes which were fed back by the
    collaborator then these will already be present on the collaborators trunk.
    If these changes were modified in any way or if they overlap with other
    changes then this will result in a conflict which could be tricky to
    resolve.</li>

    <li>Any changes which need to be fed back by the collaborator need to be
    made relative to a stable release. However, changes will have been prepared
    relative to some version of the trunk. This means that a separate branch
    will need to be taken (from the branch containing the pristine copy of the
    main site) and a custom merge will be required in order to achieve the
    desired result.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 id="patchfiles">Exchanging Changesets using Patchfiles</h3>

  <p>In some cases, an <em>FCM patch</em> may not be the best way of exchanging
  changesets. For instance, when distributing code changes which have not yet
  been finalised, you probably wouldn't want to send a patch containing all the
  individual commits to the branch on which the change is being developed. What
  you want is a summary of the changes in a single changeset. In this case you
  will often be better to use a patchfile (which can be applied using the Unix
  command <code>patch</code>). A patchfile is simply the output from an
  <code>fcm diff</code> command. For example:</p>
  <pre>
fcm diff --branch fcm:myproj-br/dev/frdm/r2134_my_branch &gt; my_patchfile
</pre>

  <p>The patchfile must be applied to a working copy of the project which
  corresponds to the same revision from which the patchfile was generated. The
  option <code>-p0</code> must be used with the <code>patch</code> command. For
  example:</p>
  <pre>
patch -p0 &lt; my_patchfile
</pre>

  <p>Patchfiles have the advantage that they are simple to generate and
  exchange and that they can combine the changes from a number of changsets
  into one. However, they have a number of limitations such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Binary files are ignored.</li>

    <li>Deleted directories are ignored.</li>

    <li>Deleted files are left as empty files.</li>

    <li>Copied files appear as new files.</li>

    <li>A moved file is treated as a deleted file and a new file.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Fortunately these limitations will not be an issue for the majority of
  changes and, where they are a problem, there are various options such as
  providing additional instructions with the patchfile, using an <em>FCM
  patch</em>, or exchanging a modified project tree.</p>

  <h2 id="further">Further Considerations</h2>

  <p>The previous sections have only considered the version control aspects of
  a collaboration. This section lists some other aspects of the collaboration
  which will need to be considered.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The FCM build system can be used regardless of what version control
    system is used. This avoids effort being wasted trying to maintain
    compatibility with an alternate build system. It also ensures that any code
    changes prepared by the collaborator are compatible with the coding
    standards which the FCM build system requires. Even if there are good
    reasons for the collaborator not to use FCM for version control, it is
    highly recommended that the FCM build system is used (assuming that is what
    is used at the central repository).</li>

    <li>Coding standards should be agreed by all collaborators.</li>

    <li>Working practices should be agreed which should define, amongst other
    things, what level of testing, review and documentation is expected to
    accompany any proposed change.</li>

    <li>All parties in the collaboration should note the advice given in the
    <a href="../user_guide/code_management.html#svn_problems">FCM user
    guide</a> to avoid renaming files or directories unless you can ensure that
    no-one is working in parallel on the affected areas of the project.</li>

    <li><acronym title="intellectual property rights">IPR</acronym>, copyright
    and license issues should be agreed by all collaborators.</li>
  </ul>
