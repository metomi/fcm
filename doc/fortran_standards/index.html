  <h2 id="intro">1. Introduction</h2>

  <p>Fortran is the standard programming language at the Met Office for
  developing scientific and research applications, in particular, for programs
  running on the supercomputers. This document describes some guidelines that
  should be followed by developers when writing Fortran code, especially for
  code in systems hosted by FCM.</p>

  <div class="span12">
  <h2 id="fcm">2. Programming Fortran for the FCM build system</h2>

  <p>To get the most out of the FCM build system, you should follow these
  guidelines when you develop your code.</p>

  <h3 id="fcm-dependency">2.1 Dependency</h3>

  <p>A program unit should be provided with the interfaces of the
  <code>SUBROUTINE</code> and/or <code>FUNCTION</code> procedures that it
  calls. Not only is this considered good practice, it also allows FCM to
  determine the dependency relationship of your source files. An interface can
  be provided in these ways:</p>

  <h4 id="fcm-dependency-internal">2.1.1 Internal sub-program</h4>

  <p>Place sub-programs in the <code>CONTAINS</code> section of a
  standalone program unit. There are two advantages for this approach.
  Firstly, the sub-programs will get an automatic interface when the
  container program unit is compiled. Secondly, it should be easier for the
  compiler to provide optimisation when the sub-programs are internal to
  the caller. The disadvantage of this approach is that the sub-programs
  are local to the caller, and so they cannot be called by other program
  units. Therefore, this approach is only suitable for small sub-programs
  local to a particular program unit.</p>

  <p>Note: One way to share a sub-program unit between several top level
  program units is to make use of the Fortran <code>INCLUDE</code>
  statement. You can write the sub-program unit in a separate file and
  place it in the <code>CONTAINS</code> section of different program units
  using <code>INCLUDE</code> statements. The disadvantage of this approach
  is that when the program is compiled, a copy of the sub-program unit will
  be embedded within each of the top level program units. This may lead to
  an increase in size of the executable, and so this approach is still only
  suitable for small sub-programs local to a small number of program
  units.</p>

  <p>For example, if we have a <code>SUBROUTINE</code> in
  <samp>sub_prog.inc</samp>:</p>

  <pre>
SUBROUTINE sub_prog(some, arg)
! Some declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
END SUBROUTINE sub_prog
</pre>

  <p>It can be placed in a <code>MODULE</code> in <samp>bar.f90</samp>:</p>

  <pre>
SUBROUTINE bar(more, arg)
! Some declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
CALL sub_prog(some, arg)
! More executable statements ...
CONTAINS
  INCLUDE 'sub_prog.inc'
END SUBROUTINE bar
</pre>

  <h4 id="fcm-dependency-module">2.1.2 Module procedures</h4>

  <p>Place sub-programs in the <code>CONTAINS</code> section of a
  <code>MODULE</code>. Again, the sub-programs will have automatic
  interfaces when the <code>MODULE</code> is compiled. If you give the
  sub-programs the PUBLIC attribute (which is the default), you will be
  able to call them from anywhere using the current <code>MODULE</code>.
  You will also gain all the advantages offered by a <code>MODULE</code>.
  (E.g. a <code>MODULE</code> will allow you to design your code in a more
  object-oriented manner.)</p>

  <p>For example, if we have a <code>MODULE</code> in
  <samp>my_mod.f90</samp>:</p>
  <pre>
MODULE my_mod
! Some module declarations
CONTAINS
  SUBROUTINE sub_prog(some, arg)
  ! Some declarations ...
  ! Some executable statements ...
  END SUBROUTINE sub_prog
END MODULE my_mod
</pre>

  <p>It can be imported to another program as such:</p>
  <pre>
SUBROUTINE foo(some, arg)
USE my_mod, ONLY: sub_prog
! Some declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
CALL sub_prog(some, arg)
! More executable statements ...
END SUBROUTINE foo
</pre>

  <h4 id="fcm-dependency-interface">2.1.3 Interface files</h4>

  <p>The FCM build system can extract the calling interfaces of each
  standalone <code>SUBROUTINE</code> or <code>FUNCTION</code> in a source
  file. The generated file is named after the original source file, but
  with the file extension replaced by <samp>*.interface</samp>. In the
  specification section of the caller routine, you will then be able to
  declare the interface using a Fortran <code>INCLUDE</code> statement to
  include the interface file. This type of <code>INCLUDE</code> statement
  is detected automatically by FCM, which will use it to set up the
  dependency tree.</p>

  <p>The advantage of using an interface file is that the caller is now
  dependent on the interface file, rather than the <code>SUBROUTINE</code>
  or <code>FUNCTION</code> itself. If you change the
  <code>SUBROUTINE</code> or <code>FUNCTION</code> without modifying its
  interface, the build system will not re-compile the caller in incremental
  build, (but it will be intelligent enough to re-link the executable with
  the updated object). Note that the same is true, to a certain extent,
  with module procedures. The build system will not re-compile any
  procedures which use the module unless the corresponding
  <samp>*.mod</samp> file has changed. However, other changes may also
  trigger changes to the <samp>.mod</samp> file. This behaviour is also
  compiler dependent.</p>

  <p>The disadvantage of using an <code>INCLUDE</code> interface file
  statement is that it is not a standard feature of the Fortran language,
  and so your application will become dependent on the FCM build system.
  There is also the danger that you forget to include the interface file in
  all the calling routines which can result in your program behaving
  incorrectly.</p>

  <p>Note: The generated interface file is named after the original source
  file. Bearing this in mind, it is worth noting that file names in a
  Unix/Linux system are case-sensitive, and so the interface file name
  declared by your <code>INCLUDE</code> statement is also case sensitive.
  If you use an incorrect case in the <code>INCLUDE</code> statement, the
  dependency tree will be set up incorrectly and the compilation will fail.
  Another problem is that if you do not name your file after the program
  unit, the dependency tree will be wrong. To avoid this problem, it is
  recommended that all source files are named in lower case after the
  program units they contain.</p>

  <p>For example, if we have a <code>SUBROUTINE</code> in
  <samp>sub_prog.f90</samp>:</p>
  <pre>
SUBROUTINE sub_prog(some, arg)
! Some declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
END SUBROUTINE sub_prog
</pre>

    <p>It can be imported to another program as such:</p>
    <pre>
SUBROUTINE egg(some, arg)
! Some declarations ...
INCLUDE 'sub_prog.interface'
! More declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
CALL sub_prog(some, arg)
! More executable statements ...
END SUBROUTINE egg
</pre>

  <h4 id="fcm-dependency-interfaces-in-module">2.1.4 Interfaces in a module</h4>

  <p>There is also a half-way house approach between the second and the
  third options. You can have a dedicated <code>MODULE</code> where a large
  number of <code>INCLUDE</code> interface file statements are placed.
  Other program units get their interfaces by importing from this
  <code>MODULE</code>. A major disadvantage of this approach is that the
  sub-programs with their interfaces declared within this
  <code>MODULE</code> will not be able to call any other sub-programs
  declared within the same <code>MODULE</code>, as it will run into a
  cyclic dependency problem. Another disadvantage is that if an interface
  changes, the <code>MODULE</code> and all program units depending on the
  <code>MODULE</code> will have to be re-compiled, even though the change
  may be unrelated to some or all of these program units. For these
  reasons, this approach is only good if you have a bundle of sub-programs
  that have relatively stable interfaces and are very much independent of
  one another.</p>

  <p>Note: a similar approach can be useful when you have a library of
  legacy or external code. In this situation, you will simply declare the
  interfaces for all the library sub-programs in the <code>MODULE</code>.
  Any programs that call sub-programs within the library can then import
  their interfaces by using the <code>MODULE</code>.</p>

  <p>For example, if we have a <samp>MODULE my_i_mod</samp>:</p>
  <pre>
MODULE my_i_mod
! Some declarations
INCLUDE 'sub_prog.interface'
! More declarations
END MODULE my_i_mod
</pre>

  <p>Its <code>PUBLIC</code> procedures can be imported as such:</p>
  <pre>
SUBROUTINE ham(some, arguments)
USE my_i_mod, ONLY: sub_prog
! Some declarations ...
! Some executable statements ...
CALL sub_prog(some, arguments)
! More executable statements ...
END SUBROUTINE ham
</pre>

  <h4 id="fcm-dependency-legacy">2.1.5 Legacy link directive</h4>

  <p>FCM also supports the use of a <code>! DEPENDS ON</code> directive for
  users to specify a dependency from within a source file. This feature is
  documented in <a href="../user_guide/make.html#build.source-analysis">FCM
  user guide &gt; FCM Make &gt; Build Source Analysis</a>. However, it is worth
  noting that this method is only included in FCM to support legacy code. It is
  not a feature recommended for new code, and its use should be gradually
  phased out from existing code.</p>

  <h3 id="fcm-interface">2.2 Automatic Interface Files</h3>

  <p>To use the automatic interface files feature of the FCM build system,
  source files containing top level <code>SUBROUTINE</code> and/or
  <code>FUNCTION</code> procedures should follow these rules:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Use the free source form.</li>

    <li>Declare arguments and local variables in different statements.

      <div class="container-fluid">
      <div class="row-fluid">
      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>bad practice</strong></p>
        <pre>
SUBROUTINE foo(a, b, c)
INTEGER :: a, b, c, i, j, k
! ...
! ...
END SUBROUTINE foo
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>nicer approach</strong></p>

        <pre>
SUBROUTINE foo(a, b, c)
INTEGER :: a, b, c
INTEGER :: i, j, k
! ...
END SUBROUTINE foo
</pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>Use the <code>ONLY</code> clause in a <code>USE &lt;module&gt;</code>
    statement to declare all imported symbols (i.e. parameters, variables,
    functions, subroutines, etc). This makes it easier to locate the source of
    each symbol, and avoids unintentional access to other <code>PUBLIC</code>
    symbols within the <code>MODULE</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="fcm-cpp">2.3 Use of C preprocessor with Fortran</h3>

  <p>We do not recommend the use of C preprocessor with Fortran. However, it is
  acknowledged that there are some situations when it is necessary to
  preprocess Fortran code. FCM supports preprocessing in two ways.
  Preprocessing can be left to the compiler or it can be done in a separate
  <a href="../user_guide/make.html#preprocess">preprocess</a> step. A separate
  preprocess step can be useful if preprocessing changes any of the following
  in a program unit:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>its name</li>

    <li>its calling interface</li>

    <li>its dependencies</li>
  </ul>

  <p>However, using a separate preprocess step is not the best way of working,
  as it adds an overhead to the build process. If your code requires
  preprocessing, you should try to design it to avoid changes in the above.</p>

  <p>In practice, the only reasonable use of C preprocessor with Fortran is for
  code selection. For example, preprocessing is useful for isolating machine
  specific libraries or instructions, where it may be appropriate to use inline
  alternatives for small sections of code. Another example is when multiple
  versions of the same procedure exist in the source tree and you need to use
  the preprocessor to select the correct version for your build.</p>

  <p>Avoid using the C preprocessor for code inclusion, as you should be able
  to do the same via the Fortran <code>INCLUDE</code> statement. You should
  also avoid embedding preprocessor macros within the continuations of a
  Fortran statement, as it can make your code very confusing.</p>

  <h2 id="fortran">3. Programming Fortran in general</h2>

  <p>The guidelines in this section are recommended practices for programming
  Fortran in general. These are guidelines you should try to adhere to when you
  are developing new code. If you are modifying existing code, you should
  adhere to its existing standard and style where possible. If you want to
  change its standard and style, you should seek prior agreements with the
  owner and the usual developers of the code. Where possible, you should try to
  maintain the same layout and style within a source file, and preferably,
  within all the source code in a particular project.</p>

  <p>When reading these guidelines, it is assumed that you already have a good
  understanding of modern Fortran terminology. It is understood that these
  guidelines may not cover every aspect of your work. In such cases, you will
  be a winner if you use a bit of common sense, and always bearing in mind that
  some other people may have to maintain the code in the future.</p>

  <p>Always test your code before releasing it. Do not ignore compiler
  warnings, as they may point you to potential problems.</p>

  <h3 id="fortran-layout">3.1 Layout and formatting</h3>

  <p>The following is a list of recommended practices for layout and formatting
  when you write code in Fortran.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Indent blocks with space characters. The use of 2 spaces per
    indentation level is wide spread at the Met Office. The use of 4 spaces per
    indentation level is most popular in the open source community because it
    is easier for the human eyes. If you are modifying existing scripts, you
    should stick to their existing styles. Otherwise, the use of 2 and 4 spaces
    per indentation level are both acceptable, as long as it is consistent
    within a source file. Where possible, comments should be indented with the
    code within a block.</li>

    <li>Use space and blank lines where appropriate to format your code to
    improve readability. (Use genuine spaces but avoid using tabs, as the
    <kbd>tab</kbd> character is not in the Fortran character set.) In the
    following example, the code on the right hand side is preferred:

      <div class="container-fluid">
      <div class="row-fluid">
      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>bad practice</strong></p>

        <pre>
DO i=1,n
  a(i)%c=10*i/n
  b(i)%d=20+i
ENDDO
IF(this==that)THEN
  distance=0
  time=0
ENDIF
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>nicer approach</strong></p>

        <pre>
DO i = 1, n
  a(i)%c = 10 * i / n
  b(i)%d = 20 + i
END DO

IF (this == that) THEN
  distance = 0
  time     = 0
END IF
</pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>Confine your line width to 80 characters, so that your code can be
    displayed on screen for side-by-side comparison and printed easily on A4
    paper.</li>

    <li>Line up your statements, where appropriate, to improve readability. For
    example:

      <div class="container-fluid">
      <div class="row-fluid">
      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>bad practice</strong></p>

        <pre>
REAL, INTENT(OUT) :: my_out(:)
REAL, INTENT(INOUT) :: my_inout(:)
REAL, INTENT(IN) :: my_in(:)
! ...
CHARACTER(LEN=256) :: my_char
! ...
my_char = 'This is a very very very very ' // &amp;
   'very very very very very very very ' // &amp;
   'very long character assignment'
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>nicer approach</strong></p>

        <pre>
REAL, INTENT(  OUT) ::   my_out(:)
REAL, INTENT(INOUT) :: my_inout(:)
REAL, INTENT(IN   ) ::    my_in(:)
! ...
CHARACTER(LEN=256) :: my_char
! ...
my_char                                       &amp;
    =  'This is a very very very very very '  &amp;
    // 'very very very very very very very '  &amp;
    // 'long character assignment'
</pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>
    </li>

    <li>Short and simple Fortran statements are easier to read and understand
    than long and complex ones. Where possible, avoid using continuation lines
    in a statement.</li>

    <li>Avoid putting multiple statements on the same line. It is not good for
    readability.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="fortran-style">3.2 Style</h3>

  <p>The following is a list of recommended styles when you write code in
  Fortran.</p>

  <p>Write Fortran in the free format source form.</p>
  
  <p>Use only the <samp>*.f90</samp> file extension (and <samp>*.F90</samp>
  for source files requiring preprocessing) for free format source files.</p>

  <p>Each source file should contain only one top level program unit, and
  should be named after the program unit it contains.</p>

  <p>New code should be written using Fortran 95 syntax. Avoid unportable
  vendor/compiler extensions. Avoid Fortran 2003 features for the moment, as
  they will not become widely available in the near future. (Having said
  that, there is no harm in designing your code with the future in mind. For
  example, if there is a feature that is not in Fortran 95 and you know that
  it is in Fortran 2003, you may want to write your Fortran 95 code to make
  it easier for the future upgrade.)</p>

  <p>Write your program in UK English, unless you have a very good reason
  for not doing so. Write your comments in simple UK English and name your
  program units and variables based on sensible UK English words, bearing in
  mind that your code may be read by people who are not proficient English
  speakers.</p>

  <p>When naming your variables and program units, always bear in mind that
  Fortran is a case-insensitive language. (E.g. <var>EditOrExit</var> is the
  same as <var>EditorExit</var>.)</p>

  <p>Use only characters in the Fortran character set. In particular, accent
  characters and tabs are not allowed in code, although they are usually OK
  in comments. If your editor inserts tabs automatically, you should
  configure it to switch off the functionality when you are editing Fortran
  source files.</p>

  <p>Although Fortran has no reserved keywords, you should avoid naming your
  program units and variables with names that match an intrinsic
  <code>FUNCTION</code> or <code>SUBROUTINE</code>. Similarly, you should
  avoid naming your program units and variables with names that match a
  <em>keyword</em> in a Fortran statement.</p>

  <p>Be generous with comments, but avoid repeating the Fortran logic in
  words. State the reason for doing something instead.</p>

  <p>To improve readability, write your program in mainly lower case
  characters. Writing a program in mainly lower case also means that you will
  not have to use the <kbd>Shift/Caps Lock</kbd> keys often, hence, improving
  your code's accessibility. There is a lot of debate on using upper/lower
  cases in a case insensitive language such as Fortran. There is no right or
  wrong, but people have adopted the different approaches over time, each has
  its own merit. If you are starting a new project, you should choose a
  suitable option and stick to it. Otherwise, you should stick with the style
  in the existing code. Some options are listed here:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The ALL CAPS Fortran keywords approach, like most of the examples
    in this document, where all Fortran keywords and intrinsic procedures
    are written in ALL CAPS. This approach has the advantage that Fortran
    keywords stand out, but it does increase how often the Shift/Caps Lock
    key is used. Programmers who are used to some other programming
    languages may also find it difficult to read a program with a lot of
    upper case characters.</li>

    <li>The Title Case Fortran keywords approach, where all Fortran
    keywords are written with an initial capital case letter.</li>

    <li>The sentence case approach, where only the initial character in a
    Fortran statements is written in capital case letter, like a normal
    sentence.</li>

    <li>The all lower case approach, where all Fortran keywords are written
    in lower case letters.</li>

    <li>Some people have also proposed a variable naming convention where
    local variables start with an initial lower case letter, private module
    level variables with an initial capital case letter and public module
    variables written in all caps. However, this approach has been seen by
    many as too restrictive, and so its use has not been widely
    spread.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Use the new and clearer syntax for <code>LOGICAL</code> comparisons,
  i.e.:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>==</code> instead of <code>.EQ.</code></li>

    <li><code>/=</code> instead of <code>.NE.</code></li>

    <li><code>&gt;</code> instead of <code>.GT.</code></li>

    <li><code>&lt;</code> instead of <code>.LT.</code></li>

    <li><code>&gt;=</code> instead of <code>.GE.</code></li>

    <li><code>&lt;=</code> instead of <code>.LE.</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Where appropriate, simplify your <code>LOGICAL</code> assignments, for
  example:</p>

  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row-fluid">
      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>bad practice</strong></p>

        <pre>
IF (my_var == some_value) THEN
  something      = .TRUE.
  something_else = .FALSE.
ELSE
  something      = .FALSE.
  something_else = .TRUE.
END IF
! ...
IF (something .EQV. .TRUE.) THEN
  CALL do_something()
  ! ...
END IF
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>nicer approach</strong></p>

        <pre>
something      = (my_var == some_value)
something_else = (my_var /= some_value)
! ...
IF (something) THEN
  CALL do_something()
  ! ...
END IF
</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Positive logic is usually easier to understand. When you have an <code>
  IF</code>-<code>ELSE</code>-<code>END IF</code> construct, you should use
  positive logic in the <code>IF</code> test, provided that the positive and
  the negative blocks are about the same size. (However, it may be more
  appropriate to use negative logic if the negative block is significantly
  bigger than the positive block.) For example:</p>

  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row-fluid">
      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>bad practice</strong></p>

        <pre>
IF (my_var != some_value) THEN
  CALL do_this()
ELSE
  CALL do_that()
END IF
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>nicer approach</strong></p>

        <pre>
IF (my_var == some_value) THEN
  CALL do_that()
ELSE
  CALL do_this()
END IF
</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Where a Fortran keyword allows an optional space to separate words, use
  it to improve readability. (However, it is worth noting that some keywords
  such as <code>ELSEWHERE</code> do not support an optional space.) The
  following keywords allow an optional space:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>ELSE IF</code></li>
    <li><code>END DO</code></li>
    <li><code>END FORALL</code></li>
    <li><code>END FUNCTION</code></li>
    <li><code>END IF</code></li>
    <li><code>END INTERFACE</code></li>
    <li><code>END MODULE</code></li>
    <li><code>END PROGRAM</code></li>
    <li><code>END SELECT</code></li>
    <li><code>END SUBROUTINE</code></li>
    <li><code>END TYPE</code></li>
    <li><code>END WHERE</code></li>
    <li><code>SELECT CASE</code></li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have a large or complex code block embedding other code blocks,
  you may consider naming some or all of them to improve readability.</p>

  <p>If you have a large or complex interface block or if you have one or
  more sub-program units in the <code>CONTAINS</code> section, you can
  improve readability by using the full version of the <code>END</code>
  statement (i.e. <code>END SUBROUTINE</code> &lt;name&gt; or <code>END
  FUNCTION</code> &lt;name&gt; instead of just <code>END</code>) at the end
  of each sub-program unit. For readability in general, the full version of
  the <code>END</code> statement is recommended over the simple
  <code>END</code>.</p>

  <p>Where possible, consider using <code>CYCLE</code>, <code>EXIT</code> or
  a <code>WHERE</code>-construct to simplify complicated
  <code>DO</code>-loops.</p>

  <p>When writing a <code>REAL</code> literal with an integer value, put a
  <code>0</code> after the decimal point (i.e. <samp>1.0</samp> as opposed to
  <samp>1.</samp>) to improve readability.</p>

  <p>Where reasonable and sensible to do so, you should try to match the
  names of dummy and actual arguments to a
  <code>SUBROUTINE</code>/<code>FUNCTION</code>.</p>

  <p>In an array assignment, it is recommended that you use array notations
  to improve readability. E.g.:</p>

  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row-fluid">
      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>bad practice</strong></p>

        <pre>
INTEGER :: array1(10, 20), array2(10, 20)
INTEGER :: scalar
! ...
array1 = 1
array2 = array1 * scalar
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>nicer approach</strong></p>

        <pre>
INTEGER :: array1(10, 20), array2(10, 20)
INTEGER :: scalar
! ...
array1(:, :) = 1
array2(:, :) = array1(:, :) * scalar
</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Where appropriate, use parentheses to improve readability. E.g.:
  <code>a = (b * i) + (c / n)</code> is easier to read than <code>a = b * i +
  c / n</code>.</p>

  <h3 id="fortran-feature">3.3 Fortran features</h3>

  <p>The following is a list of Fortran features that you should use or
  avoid.</p>

  <p>Use <code>IMPLICIT NONE</code> in all program units. It means that you
  have declare all your variables explicitly. This helps to reduce bugs in
  your program that will otherwise be difficult to track.</p>

  <p>Design your derived data types carefully and use them to group related
  variables. Appropriate use of derived data types will allow you to design
  modules and procedures with simpler and cleaner interfaces.</p>

  <p>Where possible, module variables and procedures should be declared
  <code>PRIVATE</code>. This avoids unnecessary export of symbols, promotes
  data hiding and may also help the compiler to optimise the code.</p>

  <p>Always declare an argument with an <code>INTENT</code> attribute. The
  only exception is when the argument is a <code>POINTER</code> or a
  procedure. A <code>FUNCTION</code> should only have <code>INTENT(IN)</code>
  arguments. Use a <code>SUBROUTINE</code> if any argument needs to have an
  <code>INTENT(OUT)</code> or <code>INTENT(INOUT)</code> attribute.</p>

  <p>When you are passing an array argument to a
  <code>SUBROUTINE</code>/<code>FUNCTION</code>, and the
  <code>SUBROUTINE</code>/<code>FUNCTION</code> does not change the
  <code>SIZE</code>/<code>DIMENSION</code> of the array, you should pass it
  as an assumed shape array. Memory management of such an array is
  automatically handled by the <code>SUBROUTINE</code>/<code>FUNCTION</code>,
  and you do not have to worry about having to <code>ALLOCATE</code> or
  <code>DEALLOCATE</code> your array. It also helps the compiler to optimise
  the code.</p>

  <p>Use an array <code>POINTER</code> when you are passing an array
  argument to a <code>SUBROUTINE</code>, and the <code>SUBROUTINE</code> has
  to alter the <code>SIZE</code>/<code>DIMENSION</code> of the array. You
  should also use an array <code>POINTER</code> when you need a dynamic array
  in a component of a derived data type. (Note: Fortran 2003 allows passing
  <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> arrays as arguments as well as using
  <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> arrays as components of a derived data type.
  Therefore, the need for using an array <code>POINTER</code> should be
  reduced once Fortran 2003 becomes more widely accepted.)</p>

  <p>Where possible, an <code>ALLOCATE</code> statement for an
  <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> array (or a <code>POINTER</code> used as a dynamic
  array) should be coupled with a <code>DEALLOCATE</code> within the same
  scope. If an <code>ALLOCATABLE</code> array is a <code>PUBLIC</code>
  <code>MODULE</code> variable, it is highly desirable if its memory
  allocation and deallocation are only performed in procedures within the
  <code>MODULE</code> in which it is declared. You may consider writing
  specific <code>SUBROUTINE</code>s within the <code>MODULE</code> to handle
  these memory managements.</p>

  <p>Always define a <code>POINTER</code> before using it. You can define a
  <code>POINTER</code> in its declaration by pointing it to the intrinsic
  function <code>NULL()</code>. Alternatively, you can make sure that your
  <code>POINTER</code> is defined or nullified early on in the program unit.
  Similarly, <code>NULLIFY</code> a <code>POINTER</code> when it is no longer
  in use, either by using the <code>NULLIFY</code> statement or by pointing
  your <code>POINTER</code> to <code>NULL()</code>.</p>

  <p>Avoid the <code>DIMENSION</code> attribute or statement. Declare the
  <code>DIMENSION</code> with the declared variables. E.g.:</p>

  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row-fluid">
      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>bad practice</strong></p>

        <pre>
INTEGER, DIMENSION(10) :: array1
INTEGER                :: array2
DIMENSION              :: array2(20)
</pre>
      </div>

      <div class="span6">
        <p><strong>nicer approach</strong></p>

        <pre>
INTEGER :: array1(10), array2(20)
</pre>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Avoid <code>COMMON</code> blocks and <code>BLOCK DATA</code> program
  units. Use <code>PUBLIC</code> <code>MODULE</code> variables.</p>

  <p>Avoid the <code>EQUIVALENCE</code> statament. Use a
  <code>POINTER</code> or a derived data type, and the <code>TRANSFER</code>
  intrinsic function to convert between types.</p>

  <p>Avoid the <code>PAUSE</code> statement, as your program will hang in a
  batch environment. If you need to halt your program for interactive use,
  consider using a <code>READ*</code> statement instead.</p>

  <p>Avoid the <code>ENTRY</code> statement. Use a <code>MODULE</code> or
  internal <code>SUBROUTINE</code>.</p>

  <p>Avoid the <code>GOTO</code> statement. The only commonly acceptable
  usage of <code>GOTO</code> is for error trapping. In such case, the jump
  should be to a commented <code>9999 CONTINUE</code> statement near the end
  of the program unit. Typically, you will only find error handlers beyond
  the <code>9999 CONTINUE</code> statement.</p>

  <p>Avoid assigned <code>GOTO</code>, computed <code>GOTO</code>,
  arithmetic <code>IF</code>, etc. Use the appropriate modern constructs such
  as <code>IF</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, <code>SELECT CASE</code>,
  etc..</p>

  <p>Avoid numbered statement labels. <code>DO ... label CONTINUE</code>
  constructs should be replaced by <code>DO ... END DO</code> constructs.
  <code>FORMAT</code> statements should be replaced by format strings. (Tip:
  a format string can be a <code>CHARACTER</code> variable.)</p>

  <p>Avoid the <code>FORALL</code> statement/construct. Despite what it is
  supposed to do, <code>FORALL</code> is often difficult for compilers to
  optimise. (See, for example, <a href=
  "http://www.fortran.bcs.org/2007/jubilee/f50.pdf">Implementing the
  Standards including Fortran 2003</a> by <acronym title=
  "Numerical Algorithms Group">NAG</acronym>.) Stick to the equivalent
  <code>DO</code> construct, and simple <code>WHERE</code>
  statement/construct or array assignments unless there are actual
  performance benefits using <code>FORALL</code> in your code.</p>

  <p>Avoid nested <code>WHERE</code> constructs for clarity. Stick to the
  equivalent <code>DO</code> constructs, which are often easier for humans to
  understand and for compilers to optimise.</p>

  <p>A <code>FUNCTION</code> should be <code>PURE</code>, i.e. it should
  have no side effects (e.g. altering an argument or module variable, or
  performing I/O). If you need to perform a task with side effects, you
  should use a <code>SUBROUTINE</code> instead.</p>

  <p>Avoid using a statement <code>FUNCTION</code>. Use an internal
  <code>FUNCTION</code> instead.</p>

  <p>Avoid <code>RECURSIVE</code> procedures if possible.
  <code>RECURSIVE</code> procedures are usually difficult to understand, and
  are always difficult to optimise in a supercomputer environment.</p>

  <p>Avoid using the specific names of intrinsic procedures. Use the generic
  names of intrinsic procedures where possible.</p>

  <h2 id="template">4. Program templates</h2>

  <p>The following is a basic template for a <code>FUNCTION</code>:</p>
  <pre>
[&lt;type&gt;] FUNCTION &lt;name&gt;(&lt;args, ...&gt;) [RESULT(&lt;result&gt;)]

!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

!
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USE &lt;module&gt;, ONLY : &lt;symbols, ...&gt;

IMPLICIT NONE

! Function arguments:
&lt;arguments with INTENT(IN) ...&gt;

! Function result:
&lt;declare the type returned by the function&gt;

! Local declarations:
&lt;parameters, derived data types, variables, ...&gt;

! INTERFACE blocks

  &lt;sub-programs&gt;
END FUNCTION &lt;name&gt;
</pre>

  <p>The basic templates for other types of program units are similar to that
  of a <code>FUNCTION</code>, with the following exceptions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A <code>PROGRAM</code> does not have arguments, so the arguments list
    in the header and the <cite>Arguments</cite> section in the declaration
    section should be removed. All declarations are local to a
    <code>PROGRAM</code>, so the <cite>Local Declarations</cite> section should
    be replaced by a simple <em>Declarations</em> section.</li>

    <li>A <code>SUBROUTINE</code> may have <code>INTENT(OUT)</code> and
    <code>INTENT(INOUT)</code> arguments as well.</li>

    <li>A <code>MODULE</code> does not have arguments, so the arguments list in
    the header and the <cite>Arguments</cite> section in the declaration
    section should be removed. Where appropriate, the <cite>Local
    Declarations</cite> section should be replaced by a <em>PUBLIC
    declarations</em> section and a <em>PRIVATE declarations</em> section.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>When you are distributing your code, you should include a
  <samp>COPYRIGHT.txt</samp> file at a top level directory in your source tree.
  The file should contain the detailed copyright information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the copyright year, ranging from the year the code is first distributed
