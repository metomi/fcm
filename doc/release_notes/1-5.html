  <h2 id="new">What's New?</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>fcm branch --list --show-all</code></dt>

    <dd>New option to list all branches in a project.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm keyword-print</code>: new command</dt>

    <dd>A command to print registered FCM keywords.</dd>

    <dt>New method to manage revision keywords and other keywords related
    settings.</dt>

    <dd>See <a href="../user_guide/system_admin.html#fcm-keywords">FCM User
    Guide &gt; System Administration &gt; FCM keywords</a> for detail. Note:
    the <code>SET::TRAC</code> declaration is no longer supported.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm update</code>: improvement</dt>

    <dd>The <code>fcm update</code> command applies to a whole working copy. If
    the working copy contains local changes, the command will prompt the user
    for confirmation.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 id="fix">Minor Enhancements &amp; Bug Fixes</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>fcm build</code>: new <code>NO_DEP</code> declaration to switch
    off dependency checking</dt>

    <dd>A new declaration to switch off dependency checking for a given
    name-space. See the <a href=
    "../user_guide/build.html#advanced_dependency">FCM User Guide &gt; The
    Build System &gt; Further dependency features</a> for details.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm build</code>: incorrect behaviour when dealing with the
    removal of TOOL declarations in incremental mode</dt>

    <dd><code>fcm build</code> did not always handle the removal of TOOL
    declarations from the build configuration correctly in incremental mode.
    This has been fixed.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm build</code>: new <code>TOOL::FC_MODSEARCH</code>
    declaration</dt>

    <dd>While most Fortran compilers search for the compiled module definition
    files (i.e. <samp>*.mod</samp> files) using the same option as the include
    search path (i.e. <samp>-I</samp>), some require a special option such as
    <samp>-M</samp>. The new <code>TOOL::FC_MODSEARCH</code> declaration allows
    such an option to be specified in the build configuration file.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm build</code>: incorrect logic for handling
    <code>INHERIT::SRC</code> declarations</dt>

    <dd>The logic for handling this declaration was incorrect. This led to
    deleted files being incorrectly inherited. This has been fixed.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm build</code>: incorrect logic for generating exclude
    dependency files for directory-based libraries</dt>

    <dd>These files were not being generated corectly. This has been fixed.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm build</code>: incorrect logic for handling
    <code>SRC_TYPE</code></dt>

    <dd>The system was unable to search for an include file whose type was
    declared via a <code>SRC_TYPE</code> declaration. This has been fixed.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm build</code>: improvement to the Fortran interface file
    generator</dt>

    <dd>The logic to extract the calling interfaces of top level subroutines
    and functions from Fortran source files has been rewritten, based on the
    original logic developed by the <a href="http://www.ecmwf.int">European
    Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)</a>. In particular, the
    new logic will correctly handle 1) pre-processor directives with
    continuation lines, 2) continuation and comment markers in quotes, 3)
    BLOCKDATA program units in the source file, 4) TYPE components in variable
    identifiers, and 5) multiple program units in the source file. There are
    also improvements in the new logic to reduce the number of useless
    declarations and module imports in the generated interface block.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm commit</code>: improvement to the commit message
    delimiter</dt>

    <dd>Some users found the old delimiter line confusing. This has been
    improved.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm commit</code>: <code>svn:special</code> and
    <code>svn:executable</code></dt>

    <dd>A symbolic link pointing to an executable target can cause a subsequent
    <code>svn checkout</code> to fail if the target is removed. To avoid the
    potential problem, <code>fcm commit</code> has been altered to remove the
    <code>svn:executable</code> property if a path is a symbolic link.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm extract</code>: handling of file permission changes in
    incremental mode</dt>

    <dd><code>fcm extract</code> did not handle file permission changes in
    incremental mode. This has been fixed.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm extract</code>: handling of symbolic links</dt>

    <dd>Symbolic links cannot be handled safely by <code>fcm extract</code>.
    They are now removed from the extract.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm extract</code> and <code>fcm build</code>: machine
    hostname</dt>

    <dd>The machine hostname will now be printed with the destination in the
    diagnostic output of these commands.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm extract</code>: missing <code>RDEST</code> in the on-success
    configuration file</dt>

    <dd>Some <code>RDEST</code> declarations were missing from the on-success
    generated configuration file. This has been fixed.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm extract</code>: improved options for the mirror
    sub-system</dt>

    <dd>It is now possible to specify the options of the <code>rsync</code>
    command in the extract configuration file. In addition, <code>ssh</code> is
    now the default remote shell command.</dd>

    <dt><code>fcm cmp-ext-cfg</code>: changed verbose option</dt>

    <dd>The <code>--verbose</code> option now requires an argument.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 id="issues">Known Issues</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>Build inheritance limitation: handling of include files</dt>

    <dd>See the <a href="../user_guide/build.html#advanced_inherit">FCM User
    Guide &gt; The Build System &gt; Inherit from a previous build</a> for
    detail.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h2 id="req">System Requirements</h2>

  <h3 id="req_perl">Perl</h3>

  <p>The core part of FCM is a set of Perl scripts and modules. The following
  core/CPAN Perl modules are required to invoke the <code>fcm</code>
  command:</p>
  <pre>
Carp
Cwd
File::Basename
File::Compare
File::Copy
File::Find
File::Path
File::Spec
File::Spec::Functions
File::Temp
FindBin
Getopt::Long
HTTP::Date
IO::File
List::Util
POSIX
Pod::Usage
Scalar::Util
Sys::Hostname
Text::ParseWords
URI
XML::DOM
</pre>

  <p>The following Perl modules are also required if you want to use the
  <code>fcm gui</code> command:</p>
  <pre>
Tk
Tk::ROText
</pre>

  <p>At the Met Office we are currently using FCM with Perl 5.8.2 on AIX 5.3
  and Perl 5.8.5 on RHEL 4.</p>

  <h3 id="req_svn">Subversion</h3>

  <p>To use the code management commands (and relevant parts of the extract
  system) you need to have <a href=
  "http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> installed.</p>

  <p>At the Met Office we are currently using Subversion 1.4.3. Note: FCM 1.5
  requires Subversion 1.4.x (but it has not been tested on Subversion 1.5.x or
  above).</p>

  <p>Note: you can use the extract system to mirror code to a remote platform
  for building. Therefore it is only necessary to have Subversion installed on
  the platform where you do your code development. If you use other platforms
  purely for building and running then you do not need to have Subversion
  installed on these platforms.</p>

  <h3 id="req_trac">Trac</h3>

  <p>The use of <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> is entirely
  optional (although highly recommended if you are using Subversion).</p>

  <p>At the Met Office we are currently using Trac 0.11.2.1. Note:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <code>--trac</code> and <code>--wiki</code> options to the
    <code>fcm diff --branch</code> command allow you to view branch differences
    using Trac. This requires Trac 0.10 or above.</li>

    <li>Some of the example scripts in the <samp>examples/</samp> directory
    require Trac 0.11.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="req_other">Other Requirements</h3>

  <p>The <code>fcm conflicts</code> command requires <a href=
  "http://furius.ca/xxdiff/">xxdiff</a>. At the Met Office we are currently
  using version 3.1. The <code>fcm diff --graphical</code> command also uses
  xxdiff by default although other graphical diff tools can also be used.</p>

  <p>The extract system uses <code>diff3</code>, (which is part of <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/">GNU diffutils</a>), to merge
  together changes where the same file is modified by two different branches
  (compared with the base branch). At the Met Office we are currently using
  version 2.8.1.</p>

  <p>The extract system uses <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a> to
  mirror source file to another machine. At the Met Office we are currently
  using version 2.6.3</p>

  <p>The build system requires <a href=
  "http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU make</a>. At the Met Office
  we are currently using version 3.80.</p>

  <p>FCM is intended to run on a Unix/Linux system. It is currently used at the
  Met Office on Linux (RHEL 4.8) and AIX 5.3.</p>

  <h2 id="ins">Installation</h2>

  <p>FCM is distributed in the form of a compressed tar file. Un-pack the tar
  file into an appropriate location on your system. Add the <samp>bin/</samp>
  directory into your <var>PATH</var> environment variable. Once you have done
  this you should now have full access to the FCM system, assuming that you
  have met the requirements described in the previous section.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>It executes the Subversion utility <code>svnperms.py</code> if it,
        and the associated <samp>svnperms.conf</samp> file, exist. This utility
        checks whether the author of the current transaction has enough
        permission to write to particular paths in the repository.</li>

        <li>It checks the disk space required by the current transaction. It
        fails the commit if it requires more than 5Mb of disk space.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>examples/svn-hooks/post-commit</dt>

    <dd>A simple post-commit hook script which runs the script

    <dd>
      This script runs in the background after each commit

      <ul>
        <li>It updates a <samp>&lt;repos&gt;.latest</samp> file with the latest
        revision number.</li>

        <li>It creates a dump of the new revision.</li>

        <li>It calls the script <code>background_updates.pl</code> if it
        exists.</li>

    <dd>If a user attempts to modify the log message of a changeset and he/she
    is not the original author of the changeset, this script will e-mail the
    original author. You can also set up a watch facility to monitor changes of
    log messages that affect particular paths in the repository. For further
