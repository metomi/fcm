  <h2 id="tree:reference:intro">Introduction</h2>

  <p>A tree conflict appears in <code>fcm status</code> like this:</p>
  <pre>
!     C subroutine/hello_sub_dummy.h
      &gt;   local missing, incoming edit upon merge
</pre>

  <p>and can require complex action to solve, based on the situation. Happily,
  <code>fcm conflicts</code> automates the resolution of most ordinary tree
  conflicts.</p>

  <p>This page is intended to give more information about the meaning of the
  common tree conflicts, and to give guidance on those that aren't handled
  automatically, such as directory tree conflicts.</p>

  <p>The list below is ordered by output from <code>fcm status</code>. There
  are two choices that the user must make:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>keep local</em>: Choose the local branch or revision version of a
    file or directory. Answer <samp>y</samp> in <code>fcm
    conflicts</code>.</li>

    <li><em>discard local</em>: Choose the merge branch or other revision
    version of a file or directory. Answer <samp>n</samp> in <code>fcm
    conflicts</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, if you are merging the trunk into a working copy of a branch,
  <em>keep local</em> would refer to <strong>keeping</strong> the changes as
  they existed on the branch; <em>discard local</em> would refer to accepting
  the trunk changes and <strong>discarding</strong> the branch ones.</p>

  <p>In this page, we use the word <em>local</em> for your local working copy,
  and <em>external</em> for the outside source you are updating or merging in
  from. In the example above, <em>local</em> would mean your working copy of
  the branch; <em>external</em> would mean the trunk.</p>

  <p>Subversion implements rename as a copy-and-delete operation. This means a
  rename can show up as a delete (or <em>missing</em>) in the tree conflict
  information.</p>

  <p>It's very important to find out if your tree conflict arises from a
  rename, but this information has to be dug out of <code>fcm log</code>. A
  rename can have occurred locally or externally. An external rename would show
  up in <code>fcm status</code> as an addition with history (<samp>A</samp>
  with <samp>+</samp>): for example:</p>
  <pre>
A   +   FILENAME
</pre>

  <p><code>fcm log -v FILENAME</code> can be used to examine if this is really
  just a rename - it will show up as FILENAME (from ORIGINAL_FILENAME).</p>

  <p>Local renames that have been committed won't show up in <code>fcm
  status</code>. These can still be found using <code>fcm log -v</code> for
  each filename, or you can try to remember what happened!</p>

  <h2 id="tree:reference:list">Resolution List</h2>

  <p>This section contains specific help on different types of tree
  conflict.</p>

  <p>Find the relevant section below by running <code>fcm status</code> and
  looking up the information below the file in conflict - e.g.:</p>
  <pre>
!     C subroutine/hello_sub_dummy.h
      &gt;   local delete, incoming delete upon merge
</pre>

  <p>in this case the <samp>local delete, incoming delete upon merge</samp> is
  the correct section header.</p>

  <p>There are some situations not covered below - <samp>local
  obstruction</samp> is not covered here, as it is a case of the user
  corrupting the working copy - try a new checkout. Similarly, <samp>local
  unversioned</samp> is just a case of a problem with something in the working
  copy - an unversioned file or directory exists where Subversion wants to put
  the new stuff. Delete or move it, and try the merge again.</p>

  <p>If you know that a rename has happened, use the <samp>(renaming)</samp>
  suffix for your section below. Otherwise, choose the <samp>(no
  renaming)</samp> suffix.</p>

  <p><code>fcm resolve</code> always takes the form <code>fcm resolve --accept
  working FILENAME</code> for tree conflicts.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt id="add:add"><samp>local add, incoming add upon merge</samp></dt>

    <dd>
      <p><dfn>what it means</dfn>: files or directories added with the same
      name independently</p>

      <p><dfn>what keep local does</dfn>: uses rename to shuffle the old file
      to a different name, copies the new file in, renames the new file to the
      original name but with a temporary-style suffix (e.g. hello.F90 -&gt;
      hello.F90.xD4r), and again renames the old file to the original name.
      (Then runs <code>fcm resolve</code>).</p>

      <p><dfn>what discarding local does</dfn>: renames the old file to give it
      a temporary-style suffix (e.g. hello.F90 -&gt; hello.F90.r6Ys), and
      copies the new file into the original name. (Then runs <code>fcm
      resolve</code>).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="edit:delete:no_rename"><samp>local edit, incoming delete upon merge
    (no renaming)</samp></dt>

    <dd>
      <p><dfn>meaning</dfn>: file or directory modified on the branch locally,
      but deleted on the merge branch</p>

      <p><dfn>what keep local does</dfn>: just runs <code>fcm
      resolve</code>.</p>

      <p><dfn>what discarding local does</dfn>: deletes the file or directory
      and runs <code>fcm resolve</code>.</p>

    (renaming)</samp></dt>

    <dd>
      <p><dfn>meaning</dfn>: file modified on branch locally, but renamed on
      merge branch</p>

      <p><dfn>what keep local does</dfn>: copies over the renamed file, and the
      common ancestor of the file on the branches, and uses them for a text
      conflict style merge into the old (local) filename. It then removes the
      renamed file and runs <code>fcm resolve</code>.</p>

      <p><dfn>what discarding local does</dfn>: copies over the renamed file,
      and the common ancestor of the file on the branches, and uses them for a
      text conflict style merge into the new renamed file. It then deletes the
      old file and runs <code>fcm resolve</code>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="edit:replace"><samp>local edit, incoming replace upon
    merge</samp></dt>

    <dd>
      <p><dfn>meaning</dfn>: file modified on branch locally, but replaced
      (deleted, and new file added) on merge branch</p>

      <p><dfn>what keep local does</dfn>: just runs <code>fcm
      resolve</code>.</p>

      <p><dfn>what discarding local does</dfn>: <code>svn delete</code> local
      file, and <code>svn copy</code> the incoming file into it. It then runs
      <code>fcm resolve</code>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="delete:delete:no_rename"><samp>local delete, incoming delete upon

    <dd>
      <p><dfn>meaning</dfn>: same filename deleted both locally and
      externally.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt id="delete:rename:rename"><samp>local delete, incoming delete upon
    merge (just external renaming)</samp></dt>

    <dd>

      different names.</p>

      <p><dfn>what keep local does</dfn>: copies in the external file and

      <code>xxdiff</code> into the locally-renamed filename. Removes the
      external rename and runs <code>fcm resolve</code>.</p>

      <p><dfn>what discarding local does</dfn>: copies in the external file and
      common ancestor file to construct a text-style merge using
      <code>xxdiff</code> into the externally-renamed filename. Removes the
