  <h2 id="svn">Using Subversion</h2>

  <p>One of the key strengths of Subversion is its documentation. <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/">Version Control with Subversion</a>
  (which we'll just refer to as the <cite>Subversion book</cite> from now on)
  is an excellent book which explains in detail how to use Subversion and also
  provides a good introduction to all the basic concepts of version control.
  Rather than trying to write our own explanations (and not doing as good a
  job) we will simply refer you to the <cite>Subversion book</cite>, where
  appropriate, for the relevant information.</p>

  <p>In general, the approach taken in this section is to make sure that you
  first understand how to perform a particular action using the Subversion
  tools and then describe how this differs using FCM.</p>

  <h3 id="svn_concepts">Basic Concepts</h3>

  <p>In order to use FCM you need to have a basic understanding of version
  control. If you're not already familiar with Subversion or CVS then please
  read the chapter <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.basic.html">Fundamental Concepts</a>
  from the <cite>Subversion book</cite>. In particular, make sure that you
  understand:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <q title=
    "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.basic.version-control-basics.html#svn.basic.vsn-models.copy-merge">
    Copy-Modify-Merge</q> approach to file sharing.</li>

    <li>Global Revision Numbers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that this chapter states that <q title=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.wc">
  working copies do not always correspond to any single revision in the
  repository</q>. However, the FCM working practices do not encourage this and
  the wrapper scripts provided by FCM should ensure that your working copy (a
  local copy of the repository's files and directories where you can prepare
  changes) always corresponds to exactly one revision.</p>

  <p><acronym title="Concurrent Versions System">CVS</acronym> users should
  already be familiar with all the basic concepts. This is not surprising since
  Subversion was designed as a replacement for CVS and it uses the same
  development model. However, there are some important differences which may
  confuse those more familiar with CVS. Fortunately, the appendix in the
  <cite>Subversion book</cite> <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.forcvs.html">Subversion for CVS
  Users</a> is specifically written for those moving from CVS to Subversion and
  you should read this if you are a CVS user.</p>

  <h3 id="svn_basic">Basic Command Line Usage</h3>

  <p>Before we discuss the FCM system you need to have a good understanding of
  how to perform most of the normal day-to-day tasks using Subversion.
  Therefore, unless you are already familiar with Subversion, please read the
  chapter <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.tour.html">Basic
  Usage</a> from the <cite>Subversion book</cite>.</p>

  <p>So, now you have an understanding of how to do basic tasks using
  Subversion (you did read the <cite>Basic Usage</cite> chapter didn't you?),
  how is using FCM different? Well, the key thing to remember is that, instead
  of using the command <code>svn</code> you need to use the command
  <code>fcm</code>. The advantages of this are as follows:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>fcm</code> implements all of the commands that <code>svn</code>
    does (including all the command abbreviations).</li>

    <li>In some cases <code>fcm</code> does very little and basically passes on
    the command to <code>svn</code>.</li>

    <li>In other cases <code>fcm</code> has a lot of additional functionality
    compared with the equivalent <code>svn</code> command.</li>

    <li><code>fcm</code> also implements several commands not provided by
    <code>svn</code>.</li>

    <li><code>fcm</code> provides support for URL and revision keywords.</li>

    <li>Most of the additional features and commands are discussed later in
    this section or in the following sections.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Full details of all the <code>fcm</code> commands available are provided
  in the <a href="command_ref.html">FCM Command Reference</a> section.</p>

  <h4 id="svn_basic_keywords">URL And Revision Keywords</h4>

  <p>URL keywords can be used to specify URLs in <code>fcm</code> commands. The
  syntax is <code>fcm:&lt;keyword&gt;</code>. Keywords can be defined in the
  FCM keyword configuration file (i.e. <samp>$FCM/etc/fcm/keyword.cfg</samp>
  and <samp>$HOME/.metomi/fcm/keyword.cfg</samp>).</p>

  <p>For example, if you define a keyword in your configuration file as
  follows:</p>
  <pre>
location{primary}[um] = svn://fcm2/UM_svn/UM
</pre>

  <p>then you can abbreviate the URL as in the following examples:</p>
  <pre>
# fcm ls svn://fcm2/UM_svn/UM
fcm ls fcm:um

# fcm ls svn://fcm2/UM_svn/UM/trunk
fcm ls fcm:um_tr  # OR: fcm ls fcm:um-tr

# fcm ls svn://fcm2/UM_svn/UM/branches
fcm ls fcm:um_br  # OR: fcm ls fcm:um-br

# fcm ls svn://fcm2/UM_svn/UM/tags
fcm ls fcm:um_tg  # OR: fcm ls fcm:um-tg
</pre>

  <p>Using URL keywords has two advantages.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>They are shorter and easier to remember.</li>

    <li>If the repository needs to be moved then only the keyword definitions
    need to be updated (although any working copies you have will still need to
    be <em>relocated</em> by issuing a <a href=
    "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.ref.svn.c.switch.html"><code>fcm
    switch --relocate</code></a> command).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In a similar way, revision keywords can be used to specify revision
  numbers in <code>fcm</code> commands. The keyword can be used anywhere a
  revision number can be used. Each keyword is associated with a URL keyword
  and can only be used when referring to that repository.</p>

  <p>For example, if you define a keyword in your configuration file as
  follows:</p>
  <pre>
revision[fcm:vn1.0] = 112
</pre>

  <p>then the following commands are equivalent:<br />
  <code>fcm log -r 112 svn://fcm1/FCM_svn/trunk</code><br />
  <code>fcm log -r vn1.0 fcm:fcm_tr</code></p>

  <p>You can use the <code>fcm keyword-print</code> command to print all
  registered location keywords. You can also print the location keyword and the
  revision keywords of a particular project. For example, to print the keywords
  for the <samp>UM</samp> project, you can type <code>fcm keyword-print
  fcm:um</code>.</p>

  <h4 id="svn_basic_diff">Examining Changes</h4>

  <p>Code differences can be displayed graphically using <code>xxdiff</code> by
  using the <code>--graphical</code> (or <code>-g</code>) option to <code>fcm
  diff</code>. This option can be used in combination with any other options
  which are accepted by <code>svn diff</code>.</p>

  <p>An example display from <code>xxdiff</code> is shown below.</p>

  <p class="image"><img src="xxdiff1.png" alt="xxdiff 2-way display" /><br />
  <code>xxdiff</code> 2-way display</p>

  <p>Points to note:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>By default <code>xxdiff</code> is configured to show horizontal
    differences. This means that the parts of the line which have changed are
    highlighted (e.g. the text <samp>useful</samp> is highlighted in the
    example above).</li>

    <li>The number shown to the right of each file name shows the current line
    number. The number on the far right is the number of differences found (2
    in the example above).</li>

    <li>You may find the following keyboard shortcuts useful.

      <ul>
        <li><kbd>N</kbd> - move to the next difference</li>

        <li><kbd>P</kbd> - move to the previous difference</li>

        <li><kbd>Ctrl-Q</kbd> - exit</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>If you want to use another diff tool instead of <code>xxdiff</code> to
    examine changes, you can define the <code>graphic-diff</code> setting in a
    FCM external configuration file (i.e.<samp>$FCM/etc/fcm/external.cfg</samp>
    or <samp>$HOME/.metomi/fcm/external.cfg</samp>). For example, to use <code>
      tkdiff</code>, you can do:
      <pre>
# in your site's $FCM/etc/fcm/external.cfg:
# OR: in your $HOME/.metomi/fcm/external.cfg:
graphic-diff = tkdiff
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="svn_basic_conflicts">Resolving Conflicts</h4>

  <p>Your working copy may contain files or directories <em>in conflict</em> as
  a result of an update or a merge (covered later). Conflicts arise from the
  situation where two changes being applied to a file <em>overlap</em>. These
  can be text-based, as in two changes to the same line of text in a file, or
  filesystem-based, as in two different renamings of the same file.</p>

  <p>For conflicts in normal (text) files, the command <code>fcm
  conflicts</code> can be used to help resolve them. (A discussion on binary
  files is given in the section <a href="working_practices.html#binary">Working
  with Binary Files</a> later in this document.). For each file in <em>text
  conflict</em>, the <code>fcm conflicts</code> command calls a graphical merge
  tool (i.e. <code>xxdiff</code> by default) to display a 3-way diff.</p>

  <p>An example display from <code>xxdiff</code> is shown below.</p>

  <p class="image"><img src="xxdiff2.png" alt="xxdiff 3-way display" /><br />
  <code>xxdiff</code> 3-way display</p>

  <p>Points to note:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The file in the middle is the common ancestor from the merge. The file
    on the left is your original file and the file on the right is the file
    containing the changes which you are merging in.</li>

    <li><code>xxdiff</code> is configured to automatically select regions that
    would end up being selected by an automatic merge (e.g. there are only
    changes in one of the files). Any difference <em>hunks</em> which cannot be
    resolved automatically are left <em>unselected</em>.</li>

    <li>Before you can save a merged version you need to go through each
    unselected difference hunk and decide which text you wish to use.

      <ul>
        <li>Selecting a diff hunk can be carried out by clicking on it with the
        left mouse button (or refer to the keyboard shortcuts shown under the
        <kbd>Region</kbd> menu). The colours update to display which side is
        selected for output. You can select individual lines with the middle
        mouse button.</li>

        <li>If you want to select more than one side, you have to invoke the
        <kbd>Region-&gt;Split/swap/join</kbd> command (keyboard shortcut:
        <kbd>S</kbd>). This will split the current diff hunk so you can select
        the pieces you want from both sides. Further invocations of this
        command will cause swapping of the regions, looping through all the
        different ordering possibilities, and finally joining the regions again
        (preserving selections where it is possible).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>The number on the far right is the number of unselected difference
    hunks (1 in the example above). Once this number is 0 then you are ready to
    save the merged file.</li>

    <li>If you want to see how the merged file will look with the current
    selections then select <kbd>Windows-&gt;Toggle Merged View</kbd> (keyboard
    shortcut: <kbd>Alt+Y</kbd>). An extra window then appears showing the
    merged output that updates interactively as you make selections.</li>

    <li>You may find the following keyboard shortcuts useful.

      <ul>
        <li><kbd>B</kbd> - move to the next unselected hunk</li>

        <li><kbd>O</kbd> - move to the previous unselected hunk</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>There are several different ways to exit the 3-way diff (available from
    the <kbd>File</kbd> menu):

      <ul>
        <li>Exit with MERGE (keyboard shortcut: <kbd>M</kbd>) - This saves the
        merge result. If there are any unselected difference hunks remaining
        then you will be warned and given the option of saving the file with
        conflict markers.</li>

        <li>Exit with ACCEPT (keyboard shortcut: <kbd>A</kbd>) - This saves the
        file you are merging in (i.e. the right one) as the merge result (i.e.
        you have <em>accepted</em> all the changes).</li>

        <li>Exit with REJECT (keyboard shortcut: <kbd>R</kbd>) - This saves the
        original working copy file (i.e. the left one) as the merge result
        (i.e. you have <em>rejected</em> all the changes).</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you just want to exit without making any decisions you can also
      just close the window.</p>
    </li>

    <li>For further details please read the <a href=
    "http://furius.ca/xxdiff/doc/xxdiff-doc.html"><code>xxdiff</code> users
    manual</a> (available from the <kbd>Help</kbd> menu). In particular, read
    the section <a href=
    "http://furius.ca/xxdiff/doc/xxdiff-doc.html#merging-files-and-resolving-conflicts">
    <em>Merging files and resolving conflicts</em></a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you have resolved all the conflicts in a file then you will be prompted
  on whether to run <code>svn resolved</code> on the file to signal that the
  file is no longer in conflict.</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm conflicts
Conflicts in file: Gen_setup_local1.proc
You have chosen to ACCEPT all the changes
Would you like to run "svn resolved"?
Enter "y" or "n" (or just press &lt;return&gt; for "n"): y
Resolved conflicted state of 'Gen_setup_local1.proc'
Conflicts in file: Gen_setup_remote2.proc
Merge conflicts were not all resolved
Conflicts in file: Gen_setup_remote3.proc
All merge conflicts resolved
Would you like to run "svn resolved"?
Enter "y" or "n" (or just press &lt;return&gt; for "n"): y
Resolved conflicted state of 'Gen_setup_remote3.proc'
</pre>

  <p>It is important to realise that there are some types of merge that
  <code>xxdiff</code> will not be able to help you with.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It you have 2 versions of a file, both with substantial changes to the
    same piece of code, then the <code>xxdiff</code> display will be extremely
    colourful and not very helpful.</li>

    <li>In these cases it is often easier to start with one version of the file
    and manually re-apply the changes from the other version. It might not be
    obvious how to do this and you may need to speak to the author of the other
    change to agree how this can be done. Fortunately this situation should be
    very rare.</li>

    <li>For a more detailed discussion please refer to <a href=
    "http://software.ericsink.com/scm/scm_file_merge.html">Chapter 3: File
    Merge</a> in the online book called <a href=
    "http://software.ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html">Source Control
    HOWTO</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For files in <em>tree conflict</em>, which is otherwise known as a
  structural or filesystem-based conflict, the command <code>fcm
  conflicts</code> will manually resolve the problem by prompting you to choose
  a course of action. You can either keep the file as it was before the merge
  (<em>keep local</em>), or accept the external changes to the file.</p>

  <p>The most common way to generate a tree conflict after a merge is when a
  file has been deleted or renamed on one branch, and modified on another.
  These are incompatible changes, to Subversion, and it doesn't know which
  action to take. This is the cause of the tree conflict dilemma which the user
  must solve.</p>

  <p>In the following example, the branch in the working copy has had a
  deletion of a file. The branch that is being merged in has subsequently
  modified the file, which means that you may want to incorporate these
  changes. A tree conflict is therefore flagged up.</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm merge fcm:tutorial_br/dev/bfitz/r1_366
Merge(s) available from /tutorial/branches/dev/bfitz/r1_366: 1257
About to merge in changes from /tutorial/branches/dev/bfitz/r1_366@1257 compared with /tutorial/trunk@1
This merge will result in the following change:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- Merging r2 through r1257 into '.':
   C src/subroutine/hello_sub.f90
Summary of conflicts:
  Tree conflicts: 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Would you like to go ahead with the merge?
Enter "y" or "n" (or just press &lt;return&gt; for "n"): y

(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm info src/subroutine/hello_sub.f90

  Source right: (file) svn://fcm1/tutorial_svn/tutorial/branches/dev/bfitz/r1_366/src/subroutine/hello_sub.f90@1257
</pre>

  <p>In this example, running <code>fcm conflicts</code> would give:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm conflicts
[info] src/subroutine/hello_sub.f90: in tree conflict.
Locally: deleted
Externally: modified.
Answer (y) to leave the file deleted.
Answer (n) to add the file with the changes.
Keep the local version?
Enter "y" or "n" (or just press &lt;return&gt; for "n") 
</pre>

  <p>In this example, to keep the file as it was before (in a deleted state),
  enter <samp>y</samp>.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, to accept the merge branch version of the file (adding it with
  the edited changes), enter <samp>n</samp>.</p>

  <p>There are many other types of tree conflicts that can occur, and <code>fcm
  conflicts</code> does not cover all of them. Tree conflicts arising from
  updates and switches are not covered (which should be rare under FCM working
  practice). More importantly, tree conflicts on directories are not covered,
  because of the potential nesting of conflicts within the directories. It can
  often be difficult to identify the problem and figure out the solution in the
  case of directory conflicts, and the easiest solution may be to try to
  resolve the discrepancy before the merge.</p>

  <p>For further details, see the <a href=
  "annex_quick_ref_tree_conflicts.html">Tree Conflict</a> annex</p>

  <h4 id="svn_basic_check">Adding and Removing Files</h4>

  <p>If your working copy contains files which are not under version control
  then you can use the command <code>fcm add --check</code> to add them. This
  will go through each of the files and prompt to see if you wish to put that
  file under version control using <code>svn add</code>. For each file you can
  enter <kbd>y</kbd> for yes, <kbd>n</kbd> for no or <kbd>a</kbd> to assume yes
  for all following files.</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm add -c
?      xxdiff1.png
?      xxdiff2.png
?      xxdiff3.png
?      xxdiff4.png
Add file 'xxdiff1.png'?
Enter "y", "n" or "a" (or just press &lt;return&gt; for "n"): y
A         xxdiff1.png
Add file 'xxdiff2.png'?
Enter "y", "n" or "a" (or just press &lt;return&gt; for "n"): n
Add file 'xxdiff3.png'?
Enter "y", "n" or "a" (or just press &lt;return&gt; for "n"): a
A         xxdiff3.png
A         xxdiff4.png
</pre>

  <p>Similarly, if your working copy contains files which are missing (i.e. you
  have deleted them without using <code>svn delete</code>) then you can use the
  command <code>fcm delete --check</code> to delete them. This will go through
  each of the files and prompt to see if you wish to remove that file from
  version control using <code>svn delete</code>.</p>

  <p>As noted in the <a href=
  "http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#wc-change-detection">Subversion
  FAQ</a>, it can be dangerous using these commands. If you have moved or
  copied a file then simply adding them would cause the history to be lost.
  Therefore take care to only use these commands on files which really are new
  or deleted.</p>

  <h4 id="svn_basic_commit">Committing Changes</h4>

  <p>The command <code>fcm commit</code> should be used for committing changes
  back to the repository. It differs from the <code>svn commit</code> command
  in a number of important ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Your working copy <em>must</em> be up to date. <code>fcm commit</code>
    will abort if it finds that any files are out of date with respect to the
    repository. This ensures that your working copy reflects how the repository
    will be after you have committed your changes.

      <ul>
        <li>This helps to ensure that any tests you have done prior to
        committing are valid.</li>

        <li><code>fcm commit</code> is not suitable if you need to commit
        changes from a working copy containing mixed revisions. However, you
        are very unlikely to need to do this.</li>

        <li>Actually there is a small chance that your working copy might not
        be up to date when you commit if someone else is committing some
        changes at the same time. However, this should very seldom happen and,
        even if it does, the commit would fail if any of the files being
        changed became out of date (i.e. it is not possible to lose any
        changes).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>If it discovers a file named <samp>#commit_message#</samp> in the top
    level of your working copy it uses this to provide a template commit
    message (which you can then edit).

      <ul>
        <li>If you have performed a merge then a message describing the merge
        will have been added to this file. It is important that you leave this
        included in the commit message and do not change its format, as it is
        used by the <code>fcm branch-info</code> command.</li>

        <li>You can, if you wish, add entries to this file as you go along to
        record what changes you have prepared in your working copy. You can
        also use the command <code>fcm commit --dry-run</code> to allow you to
        edit the commit message without committing any changes.</li>

        <li><samp>#commit_message#</samp> is ignored by Subversion (so you
        won't see it show up as an unversioned files when you run <code>fcm
        status</code>).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>It always operates from the top of your working copy. If you issue the
    <code>fcm commit</code> command from a sub-directory of your working copy
    then it will automatically work out the top directory and work from there.

      <ul>
        <li>This ensures that any template commit message gets picked up and
        that you do not, for example, accidently commit a partial set of
        changes from a merge.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>It always commits <em>all</em> the changes in your working copy (it
    does not accept a list of files to commit).

      <ul>
        <li>Once again, this avoids any danger of accidently committing a
        partial set of changes.</li>

        <li>You should only work on one change within a working copy. If you
        need to prepare another, unrelated change then use a separate working
        copy.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>It runs <code>svn update</code> after the commit to ensure that your
    working copy is at the latest revision and to avoid any confusion caused by
    your working copy containing mixed revisions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="svn_branching">Branching And Merging</h3>

  <p>Branching is a fundamental concept common to most version control systems.
  For a good introduction please read the chapter <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.branchmerge.html">Branching and
  Merging</a> from the <cite>Subversion book</cite>. Even if you are already
  familiar with branching using other version control systems you should still
  read this chapter to see how branching is implemented in Subversion.</p>

  <p>Having read this chapter from the <cite>Subversion book</cite> you should
  understand:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Why each project directory has sub-directories called <em>trunk</em>,
    <em>branches</em> and <em>tags</em>. This structure is assumed by
    <code>fcm</code> (Subversion recommends it but doesn't insist on it).</li>

    <li>That when you make a branch you are taking a copy of the entire project
    file tree. Fortunately, the design of the Subversion repository means that
    these copies are <q title=
    "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.branchmerge.using.html#svn.branchmerge.using.create">
    cheap</q> - they are quick to create and take very little space.</li>

    <li>That Subversion has only implemented merge tracking recently,
    long after FCM has implemented its own solution optimised for our
    recommended working practice.</li>

    <li>That each revision of your repository can also be thought of as a
    <em>changeset</em>.</li>

    <li>That once a change is committed to a repository it cannot be removed
    (only reversed). Therefore you must take care not to committ a sensitive
    document or a large data file unintentionally.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>FCM provides various commands which make working with branches easier (as
  described in the following sections).</p>

  <h4 id="svn_branching_create">Creating Branches</h4>

  <p>The command <code>fcm branch-create</code> (or simply <code>fcm
  bcreate</code> or even <code>fcm bc</code>) should be used for creating new
  branches. It provides a number of features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>It applies a standard naming convention for branches. The branch name
    is automatically constructed for you depending on the option(s) supplied to
    the command. The full detail of these options are described in the <a href=
    "command_ref.html#fcm-branch-create">FCM Command Reference &gt; fcm
    branch-create</a> section.</li>

    <li>By default, it assumes that you are branching from the last changed
    revision of the <em>trunk</em>.

      <ul>
        <li>You can use the <code>--branch-of-branch</code> option if you need
        to create a branch of a branch. A branch of a branch can be useful in
        many situations. For example, consider a shared branch used by several
        members of your team to develop, say, a new science scheme, and you
        have come up with some different ideas of implementing the scheme. You
        may want to create a branch of the shared branch to develop your idea
        before merging it back to the shared branch. Note that you can only
        merge a branch of a branch with it's parent or with another branch
        created from the same parent. You can't, for example, merge it with the
        trunk.</li>

        <li>You can do <code>fcm bc NAME SOURCE@REV</code> if you
        need to create a branch from an earlier revision of the SOURCE.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Each branch always contains a full copy of the trunk (or its parent
    branch) - you cannot create a branch from a sub-tree.

      <ul>
        <li>There would be no reason to only include a sub-tree in a
        branch.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>It applies a standard commit message which defines how the branch has
    been created. If a Trac ticket is specified using the <code>--ticket
    &lt;number&gt;</code> option, it is added to the commit log message. If you
    need to add anything to the commit log message, please do so
    <strong>above</strong> the line that says <samp>--Add your commit message
    ABOVE - do not alter this line or those below--</samp>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following is a list of the different types of branches available:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>User development branches</dt>

    <dd><samp>branches/dev/&lt;Userid&gt;/&lt;Branch_Name&gt;</samp> These are
    for changes which are intended to be merged back to the trunk once they are
    complete. Most branches will belong to this type. e.g.
    branches/dev/frdm/vn6.1_ImprovedDeepConvection,
    branches/dev/frdm/r2134_NewBranchNamingConvention.</dd>

    <dt>Shared development branches</dt>

    <dd><samp>branches/dev/Share/&lt;Branch_Name&gt;</samp></dd>

    <dt>User test branches</dt>

    <dd><samp>branches/test/&lt;Userid&gt;/&lt;Branch_Name&gt;</samp> These are
    for changes which are <em>not</em> intended for the trunk. e.g. Proof of
    concept work, temporary code written for dealing with a one-off problem,
    etc.</dd>

    <dt>Shared test branches</dt>

    <dd><samp>branches/test/Share/&lt;Branch_Name&gt;</samp></dd>

    <dt>User packages</dt>

    <dd><samp>branches/pkg/&lt;Userid&gt;/&lt;Branch_Name&gt;</samp> These are
    branches which combine together a number of different development branches.
    Sometimes this will simply be for testing purposes (i.e. for testing a
    branch in combination with other branches). Other times it may be the
    package which eventually gets merged to the trunk (rather than the
    development branches). e.g.
    branches/pkg/frdm/vn6.1_TestImprovedDeepConvection</dd>

    <dt>Shared packages</dt>

    <dd><samp>branches/pkg/Share/&lt;Branch_Name&gt;</samp> E.g.
    branches/pkg/Share/vn6.1_NewConvectionScheme.</dd>

    <dt>Configurations</dt>

    <dd><samp>branches/pkg/Config/&lt;Branch_Name&gt;</samp> These are major
    packages which combine together a number of different packages and
    development branches. e.g. branches/pkg/Config/vn6.1_HadGEM1a.</dd>

    <dt>Releases</dt>

    <dd><samp>branches/pkg/Rel/&lt;Branch_Name&gt;</samp> These may be bug-fix
    branches for system releases, if required. They can also be branches on
    which stable releases are prepared if you don't do this on the trunk
    (although you lose the ability to branch from stable releases if you work
    this way). e.g. branches/pkg/Rel/vn6.1_BugFixes.</dd>

  <h4 id="svn_branching_list">Listing Branches Created by You or Other
  Users</h4>

  <p>The command <code>fcm branch-list</code> (or simply <code>fcm bls</code>)
  can be used to list the branches you have created at the HEAD of a
  repository. If you specify the <code>--user &lt;userid&gt;</code> option, the
  branches created by &lt;userid&gt; are listed instead. You can specify
  multiple users with multiple <code>--user &lt;userid&gt;</code> options, or
  with a colon (:) separated list to a single <code>--user
  &lt;userid:list&gt;</code> option. Note that you can also list shared
  branches by specifying &lt;userid&gt; as <code>Share</code>, configuration
  branches by specifying &lt;userid&gt; as <code>Config</code> and release
  branches by specifying &lt;userid&gt; as <code>Rel</code>. The command
  returns 0 (success) if one or more branches is found for the specified users,
  or 1 (failure) if no branch is found.</p>

  <h4 id="svn_branching_info">Getting Information About Branches</h4>

  <p>The command <code>fcm branch-info</code> (or simply <code>fcm
  binfo</code>) can be used to get various information about a branch. In
  particular, it summarises information about merges to and from the branch and
  its parent.</p>
  <pre>

</pre>

  <p>If you need information on the current children of the branch, use the
  <code>--show-children</code> option of the <code>fcm branch-info</code>
  command. If you need information on recent merges to and from the branch and
  its siblings, use the <code>--show-siblings</code> option of the <code>fcm
  branch-info</code> command.</p>

  <p>To find out what changes have been made on a branch relative to its parent
  you can use the command <code>fcm branch-diff</code> (or simply <code>fcm
  bdi</code>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You can combine this with the options:

      <dl>
        <dt><code>--graphical</code></dt>

        <dd>to display the differences using a graphical <em>diff</em>
        tool</dd>

        <dt><code>--trac</code></dt>

        <dd>to display the differences using Trac</dd>

        <dt><code>--wiki</code></dt>

        <dd>to print a wiki syntax suitable for inserting into Trac</dd>
      </dl>
    </li>

    <li>The base of the difference is adjusted to account for any merges from
    the branch to its parent or vice-versa.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4 id="svn_branching_switch">Switching your working copy to point to another
  branch</h4>

  <p>The command <code>fcm switch</code> can be used to switch your working
  copy to point to another branch. For example, if you have a working copy at
  <samp>$HOME/work</samp>, currently pointing to the trunk or a branch of a
  project at <samp>svn://fcm1/FCM_svn/FCM/trunk</samp>, you can switch the
  working copy to point to another branch of same project:</p>
  <pre>
(Shell prompt)$ cd $HOME/work
(Shell prompt)$ fcm sw dev/frsn/r959_blockdata
-&gt; svn switch --revision HEAD svn://fcm1/FCM_svn/FCM/branches/dev/frsn/r959_blockdata

U    src/bin/fcm_internal
U    src/bin/fcm_gui
Updated to revision 1009.
</pre>

  <p>Unlike <code>svn switch</code>, <code>fcm switch</code> does extra
  checking to ensure that your whole working copy is switched to the new branch
  at the correct level of sub-directory. In addition, you can specify only the
  <em>branch</em> part of the URL, such as <samp>trunk</samp>,
  <samp>branches/dev/fred/r1234_bob</samp> or even
  <samp>dev/fred/r1234_bob</samp> and the command will work out the full URL
  for you.</p>

  <h4 id="svn_branching_delete">Deleting Branches</h4>

  <p>The command <code>fcm branch-delete</code> (or simply <code>fcm
  bdel</code>) can be used to delete branches which are no longer required.
  Before being asked to confirm that you want to delete the branch, you will
  first see the same output as from <code>fcm branch-info</code>. This allows
  you to check, for example, whether your branch is being used anywhere else or
  whether the latest changes on your branch have been merged to the trunk. You
  will be prompted to edit your commit log message. If you need to add anything
  to the commit log message, please do so <strong>above</strong> the line that
  says <samp>--Add your commit message ABOVE - do not alter this line or those
  below--</samp>.</p>

  <h4 id="svn_branching_merge">Merging</h4>

  <p>As mentioned earlier, <code>fcm</code> has its own merge tracking solution
  which is optimised for our recommended working practice. The solution assumes
  the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>That all merges are performed using FCM and are identified using a
    standard template in the commit log message.</li>

    <li>That you only ever merge all the changes available on the source branch
    up to a chosen point (i.e. you can't only include a subset of the changes
    made to the branch).</li>

    <li>That the source and target are both branches (or the trunk) in the same
    FCM project.</li>

    <li>That the source and target are directly related, i.e. they must either
    have a parent/child relationship or they are siblings from the same parent
    branch.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Note that the term <em>source branch</em> and <em>target branch</em>
  referred to above can also mean the trunk.</p>

  <p>To perform a merge, use the command <code>fcm merge &lt;source&gt;</code>.
  This includes a number of important features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If it finds any local modifications in your working copy then it checks
    whether you wish to continue (in most cases you won't want to mix a merge
    with other changes).</li>

    <li>It determines the base revision and path of the <em>common
    ancestor</em> to be used for the merge, taking into account any merges from
    the <em>source</em> to the <em>target</em> or vice-versa.</li>

    <li>Before doing the merge, (unless you specify the
    <code>--non-interactive</code> option), it reports what changes will result
    from performing the merge and checks that you wish to continue.</li>

    <li>It adds details of the merge, using a standard template, into the
    commit message file (<samp>#commit_message#</samp>). If you need to add any
    extra comment, you should do so <strong>above</strong> the line that says
    <samp>--Add your commit message ABOVE - do not alter this line or those
    below--</samp>.

      <ul>
        <li>If you decide to revert the merge, you should remove the template
        line manually from the commit message file, making sure that you do not
        alter the standard template by accident.</li>

        <li>If the <code>--auto-log</code> option is specified, it adds the log
        messages of the merged revisions as well as the standard template. This
        is particularly useful when a small change is prepared in a branch, and
        often the same commit log messages have to be repeated when the change is
        merged and committed to the trunk. The option does not work very well if
        the branch contains merges from another branch.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="svn_gui">Using the GUI</h3>

  <p>So far, all the tools described have been command line tools. Many people
  will be happy with these but, for those who prefer it, there is also a simple
  Graphical User Interface (GUI).</p>

  <h4 id="svn_gui_start">Starting the GUI</h4>

  <p>To run the GUI simply issue the command <code>fcm gui</code> from the
  directory you want as your working directory.</p>

  <p>The GUI consists of several sections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The top section contains a row of buttons to allow you to select which
    command you want to run.</li>

    <li>Beneath this is shown the current working directory and the top level
    directory of your working copy (these may be the same).</li>

    <li>Beneath this come various buttons and entry boxes to allow you to
    configure the command you have selected. These vary according to the
    command.</li>

    <li>Beneath this comes a further row of buttons

      <ul>
        <li><em>Quit</em> - this exits the GUI.</li>

        <li><em>Help</em> - this displays the help message for the selected
        command.</li>

        <li><em>Clear</em> - this empties the text window.</li>

        <li><em>Run</em> - this allows you to run your command.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Beneath this comes a scrolling text window where the output from the
    commands is displayed.</li>

    <li>The bottom section displays help information when you position the
    cursor over various parts of the GUI.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="image"><img src="gui1.png" alt=
  "Example GUI screen with the Status commands selected" /><br />
  Example GUI screen with the <kbd>Status</kbd> commands selected</p>

  <p>If you run a more complicated command, like <code>fcm
  branch-create</code>, which prompts for input then extra entry windows will
  pop up.</p>

  <p class="image"><img src="gui2.png" alt="Example GUI pop-up window" /><br />
  Example GUI pop-up window</p>

  <h4 id="svn_gui_commands">GUI Commands</h4>

  <p>The commands available from the GUI should be self explanatory. A few
  points to note:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the current directory is not a working copy, you will only be able
    to Checkout a working copy or create a branch from the GUI.</li>

    <li>The <kbd>Checkout</kbd> command is only available if you start the GUI
    in a directory which is not already a working copy. After successfully
    running a checkout the GUI automatically sets the working directory to the
    top of this new working copy.</li>

    <li>With some commands (Status, Diff, Add, Delete, Conflicts) you can
    choose whether to run from the top level of your working copy or from your
    working directory. With the remaining commands this would not make sense
    and they can only be run from the top level.</li>

    <li>You can only issue commands from the GUI if they do not need to prompt
    you for authentication (i.e. the Subversion command can be run with the
    <code>--non-interactive</code> option).

      <ul>
        <li>If authentication is required then the command issued by the GUI
        will fail. For the <code>branch-create</code>,
        <code>branch-delete</code> and <code>commit</code> commands, which
        support the <code>--password</code> option, you should specify your
        password in <kbd>Other options</kbd> and click <kbd>Run</kbd> again.
        For other commands, you should run the command in interactive mode on
        the command line. Use the command displayed in the GUI text window but
        remove the <code>--non-interactive</code> option.</li>

        <li>Most repositories will be configured so that you only need
        authentication for writing (not reading). Therefore, the first command
        requiring authentication will probably be creating a branch or
        commiting to the trunk.</li>

        <li>You should only need to do this the first time you ever issue such
        a command on a each repository (unless the repository is moved to a new
        location) since the Subversion client caches this information for
        future comamnds .</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="svn_problems">Known Problems with Subversion</h3>

  <p>There is a limitation with Subversion which you should be aware of. The
  <code>svn rename</code> command is not a true rename/move operation, but is
  implemented as a copy and delete. As a result, if you rename an item in a
  branch, and later attempt to merge it back to the trunk, the operation may
  not be handled correctly by <code>svn merge</code> (see <a href=
  "http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=898">subversion issue
  898</a> for further details). Until such time as support for a <q title=
  "http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=898">true rename</q> is
  implemented in Subversion, you should avoid renaming of files or directories
  unless you can ensure that no-one is working in parallel on the affected
  areas of the project.</p>

  <h2 id="trac">Using Trac</h2>

  <p><cite>Trac</cite> has a simple and intuitive web interface which is
  relatively easy to pick up. It also includes a <a href=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracGuide">User and Administration Guide</a>
  which is full of helpful information (and is referred to extensively in this
  section).</p>

  <p>Trac contains a menu bar at the top of each page (which we will refer to
  as the <cite>Trac menu</cite>). This provides access to all the main
  features.</p>

  <h3 id="trac_login">Logging In</h3>

  <p>Although different projects may choose their own rules, we expect that
  most systems will have Trac configured so that all the information is
  viewable by anyone. However, in order to make any changes you will need to
  login. This ensures that any changes are identified with the appropriate
  userid.</p>

  <p>In the rest of this section it is assumed that you have logged in to Trac
  and are therefore able to make changes.</p>

  <p>If you haven't yet got a Trac userid (which should be the same as the
  userid you use for committing changes to Subversion) then please contact your
  system manager.</p>

  <h3 id="trac_wiki">Using the Wiki Pages</h3>

  <p>A wiki enables documents to be written in a simple markup language using a
  web browser. See the Trac Guide for information on the <a href=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracWiki">Trac Wiki Engine</a>. Make sure that
  you read the information provided on:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiFormatting">Wiki
    Formatting</a> which explains how to format your wiki pages.</li>

    <li><a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiPageNames">Wiki Page
    Names</a> which explains how <em>CamelCase</em> is used to create <a href=
    "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/WikiNewPage">New Wiki Pages</a>.</li>

    <li><a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracLinks">Trac Links</a> which
    allow hyperlinking between Trac entities (tickets, reports, changesets,
    Wiki pages, milestones and source files). This is a fundamental feature of
    Trac which makes it easy, for example, to link a bug report (ticket) to the
    changeset which fixed the bug (and vice-versa).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Whenever you are viewing a wiki page in Trac you should see several
  buttons at the bottom of the page:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><kbd>Edit This Page</kbd> - Clicking this will bring up a page where
    you can edit the page contents. Before saving your changes you can preview
    how the modified page will appear. You can also leave a comment explaining
    what changes you made.</li>

    <li><kbd>Attach File</kbd> - Allows you to attach files to a page, e.g. an

  <h3 id="trac_browser">Using the Repository Browser</h3>

  <p>The <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracBrowser">Trac Browser</a>
  is used to view the contents of your repository. To get to it just select
  <kbd>Browse Source</kbd> from the Trac menu. You can view directories and
  files at any version, see their revision histories and view <a href=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracChangeset">changesets</a>. Any wiki
  formatting in log messages is recognised and interpreted so you can easily
  link a changeset to a Trac ticket by using <a href=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracLinks">Trac Links</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="trac_tickets">Using the Issue Tracker</h3>

  <p>The Trac issue database provides a way of tracking issues within a project
  (e.g. bug reports, feature requests, software support issues, project tasks).
  Within Trac an issue is often referred to as a <em>Ticket</em>.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the Trac Guide for the following information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracTickets">The Trac Ticket
      System</a> - Creating and modifying tickets.

      <ul>
        <li>Only Trac accounts with admin rights can modify ticket
        descriptions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracQuery">Trac Ticket
    Queries</a> - List tickets matching your chosen criterion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="trac_roadmap">Using the Roadmap</h3>

  <p>Each ticket can be assigned to a milestone. The Trac Roadmap can then be
  used to provide a view on the ticket system. This can useful to see what
  changes went into a particular system release or what changes are outstanding
  before a milestone can be reached.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the Trac Guide for further information on the <a href=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracRoadmap">Trac Roadmap</a>.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Only Trac accounts with admin rights can add, modify and remove
    milestones using the web interface.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="trac_timeline">Using the Timeline</h3>

  <p>The <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracTimeline">Trac Timeline</a>
  allows you to list all the activity on a project over any given period. It
  can list:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Creation and changes to wiki pages.</li>

    <li>Creation, closure and changes to tickets.</li>

    <li>Commits to the Subversion repository.</li>

    <li>Milestones reached.</li>
  </ul>
