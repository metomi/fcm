  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>This chapter takes a <em>hands-on</em> approach to help you set up your
  FCM session, and familiarise yourself with some of the system's basic
  concepts and working practices. It is designed to complement other sections
  of the User Guide.</p>

  <p>You may also find it useful to refer to the <a href=
  "annex_quick_ref.html">Annex: Quick reference</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="setup">How to set yourself up to run FCM</h2>

  <p>It is easy to set yourself up to run FCM. Simply follow the steps
  below:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Installation</dt>

    <dd>If FCM is not yet installed at your site, please refer to the <a href=
    "../installation/">FCM: Installation</a> for detail.</dd>

    <dt>Configure your editor for Subversion</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>When you attempt to create a branch or commit changes to the
      repository, you will normally be prompted to edit your commit log message
      using a text editor. The order of priority for determining the editor
      command (where lower-numbered locations take precedence over
      higher-numbered locations) is:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>environment variable <var>SVN_EDITOR</var></li>

        <li>the <var>editor-cmd</var> option in the <var>[helpers]</var>
        section of the user's <samp>$HOME/.subversion/config</samp> file.</li>

        <li>environment variable <var>VISUAL</var></li>

        <li>environment variable <var>EDITOR</var></li>

        <li>default to <code>vi</code> (or <code>gedit</code> when running the
        FCM GUI)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>It is worth bearing in mind that an editor must be able to run in the
      foreground. For example, you can add one of the followings in your
      <samp>$HOME/.kshrc</samp> (ksh) or <samp>$HOME/.bashrc</samp> (bash):</p>
      <pre>
# GVim
export SVN_EDITOR='gvim -f'

# Emacs
export SVN_EDITOR=emacs

# gedit
export SVN_EDITOR=gedit

# Kate
export SVN_EDITOR=kate
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt>Configure your e-mail address in Trac</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Trac can be configured to send automatic e-mail notifications to
      authors of any ticket whenever there are changes to that ticket (and we
      would expect most systems to be configured in this way). You should check
      that the settings for your name and e-mail address are correct. To do
      this you need to go to the Settings page once you are logged into Trac.
      (Click on <kbd>Settings</kbd> just above the menu bar). Check that your
      settings are entered correctly.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Configure your web browser</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>FCM assumes that <code>firefox</code> is the command to invoke your
      default web browser. If you use another web browser, you should configure
      it in your <samp>$HOME/.metomi/fcm/external.cfg</samp> file. See the
      section on <a href="command_ref.html#fcm-browse">fcm browse</a> for
      further information.</p>

  <h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>

  <h3 id="tutorial_intro">Introduction</h3>

  <p>This tutorial leads you through the basics of using FCM to make changes to
  your source code, and demonstrates the recommended practices for working with
  it. A tutorial Subversion repository, with its own Trac system, is available
  for you to practice for working with the FCM system. You will work through
  the following activities:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#tutorial_create-ticket">Create a new ticket</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_create-branch">Create a branch</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_checkout">Checkout a working copy</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_change">Make changes to files in your working
    copy</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_commit">Commit your changes to the
    repository</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_extract">Test your changes</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_merge">Merge changes from the trunk and resolve
    conflicts</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_review-ticket">Review changes</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_merge-back">Commit to the trunk</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_extra-extract">Extra activities on the extract and
    build systems</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_delete-branch">Delete your branch</a></li>

    <li><a href="#tutorial_delete-final-comments">Final comments</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>We recommend that you create a work area in your filespace, for example,
  <samp>$HOME/tutorial/work</samp> for your working copy, and
  <samp>$HOME/tutorial/test</samp> for your build test.</p>

  <p>If you have not already done so, you should set up your desktop
  environment as described above in the <a href="#setup">How to set yourself up
  to run FCM</a> section.</p>

  <p>It is also worth knowing that the <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/">Subversion Book</a> is a great source
  of reference of Subversion features. In particular, the <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.basic.html">Fundamental Concepts</a>
  and <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.tour.html">Basic
  Usage</a> chapters are well worth reading.</p>

  <h3 id="tutorial_create-ticket">Create a new ticket</h3>

  <p><em>Trac is an integrated web-based issue tracker and wiki system. You
  will use it to manage and keep track of changes in your project. The issue
  tracker is called the ticket system. When you want to report a problem or
  submit a change request, you will create a new ticket. In a typical
  situation, you and/or your colleagues will make changes to your system in
  order to resolve the problem or change request, and you will monitor these
  changes via the ticket.</em></p>

  <p>After completing this sub-section, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>launch a Trac system,</li>

    <li>create a new Trac ticket,</li>

    <li>search for a Trac ticket, and</li>

    <li>accept a Trac ticket.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Further reading:</p>

    <li>Code Management System &gt; <a href=
    "code_management.html#svn_basic">Basic Command Line Usage</a></li>

    <li>Code Management System &gt; <a href="code_management.html#trac">Using
    Trac</a></li>

    <li>FCM Command Reference &gt; <a href="command_ref.html#fcm-browse">fcm
    browse</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Launch a Trac system</h4>

  <p>To launch the Trac system for the tutorial: type and <kbd>Enter</kbd> the
  following command:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm browse fcm:tutorial
</pre>

  <p>This is probably the first time you have used the <code>fcm</code>
  command. The command has the general syntax:</p>
  <pre>
fcm &lt;sub-command&gt; [&lt;options...&gt;] &lt;arguments&gt;
</pre>

  <p>For example, if you type <code>fcm help</code>, it will display a listing
  of what sub-commands are available, and if you type <code>fcm help
  &lt;sub-command&gt;</code>, it will display help for that particular
  sub-command.</p>

  <p>The <code>trac</code> sub-command launches the corresponding Trac system
  browser for a Subversion URL specified in your argument. In this case, we are
  asking it to display the Trac system browser for the tutorial. The argument
  <samp>fcm:tutorial</samp> is a FCM URL keyword and will be expanded by FCM
  into a real Subversion URL (e.g.
  <samp>svn://fcm1/tutorial_svn/tutorial</samp>). You are encouraged to use FCM
  URL keywords throughout the tutorial, as it will save you a lot of
  typing.</p>

  <p>Note: Although we use the Trac system as a browser for a Subversion
  repository, they do not interact in any other ways. Having access to a Trac
  system does not guarantee the same privilege to a Subversion repository. In
  particular, you should note the differences between the URLs of a Subversion
  repository path and its equivalence in a Trac browser.</p>

  <p>There are other ways to launch the Trac system for a project. If you know
  its URL, you can launch the Trac system by entering it in the address box of
  your favourite browser. If you often access a Trac system for a particular
  project, you should bookmark it in your favourite browser.</p>

  <h4>Create a new Trac ticket</h4>

  <p>Click on <kbd>Login</kbd> just above the menu bar, enter your Unix/Linux
  user ID as your user name and leave the password empty. Then click on
  <kbd>OK</kbd> to proceed.</p>

  <p>Once you have logged in, the <kbd>New Ticket</kbd> link will become
  available on the menu bar. Click on it to display a new ticket form, where
  you can enter details about your problem or change request. In the tutorial,
  it does not matter what you enter, but you should feel free to play around
  with wiki formatting when entering the <em>Full description</em>. (Click on
  <kbd>WikiFormatting</kbd> to see how you can use it.) For example:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Short summary:
      <pre>
Tutorial to change repository files and resolve conflicts with the trunk
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Full description:
      <pre>
In this tutorial, I shall:
 1. use FCM commands
 2. play with WikiFormatting in Trac tickets     
 3. create a branch and checkout a working copy
 4. make changes to files in it
 5. commit my changes and assign the ticket for review
 6. record the review and assign the ticket back to the author
 7. merge in the trunk, and resolve any conflicts 
 8. merge my changes back to the trunk
 9. close the ticket
 10. delete my branch
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Feel free to select an option you desire for each of the other ticket
    properties: Type, Component, Priority, Version and Milestone.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>At the bottom of the page, click the <kbd>Preview</kbd> button to see what
  the description would look like. When you are happy, click the <kbd>Submit
  changes</kbd> button. Trac will create the new ticket and return it in a
  state where you can append to it.</p>

  <p>When the ticket is created, you should get an automatic e-mail notication
  from the Trac system. In real life, depending on the setting, the owner of
  your Trac system may also get a similar e-mail notification. It is worth
  noting that each time the ticket is modified, the Trac system will send out
  an e-mail notification to you (the reporter) and anyone who modified the
  ticket subsequently.</p>

  <h4>Search for a Trac ticket</h4>

  <p>You should remember the number of your new ticket, as you will have to
  revisit it later.</p>

  <p>In real work, it is often not practical to have to remember the numbers of
  all the tickets you have created. Trac provides a powerful custom query for
  searching a ticket. You can search for the ticket you have just created by
  clicking the <kbd>View Tickets</kbd> link. Feel free to play with the custom
  query tool. Add or remove filters and try grouping your results by different
  categories.</p>

  <p>In addition, you can search your ticket using the keyword
  <kbd>Search</kbd> utility at the top right hand corner of each Trac page. (If
  you enter <kbd>#&lt;number&gt;</kbd> in the search box, it will take you
  directly to that ticket.) In the tutorial, however, it may be easiest if you
  simply leave the tutorial Trac system open, so that you do not have to login
  again when you come back to your ticket.</p>

  <h4>Start work on your Trac ticket</h4>

  <p>The status of the ticket is <em>new</em>. When you start working on a
  problem reported in a ticket it is good practice to change the status to
  <em>in_progress</em> to indicate that you are working on it. For the purpose
  of the tutorial, however, this is entirely optional since you know you will
  be doing all the work any way.</p>

  <p>To start work on a ticket, click on <kbd>start work</kbd> in the
  <em>Action</em> box at the bottom of the page, and then click on <kbd>Submit
  changes</kbd>.</p>

  <h3 id="tutorial_create-branch">Create a branch</h3>

  <p><em>You create a branch by making a copy of your project at a particular
  revision. Most often, this will be a particular revision of the trunk, i.e.
  the main branch/development line in your project. A branch resides in the
  repository. It allows you to work in parallel with your colleagues without
  affecting one another, while keeping your changes under version
  control.</em></p>

  <p>After completing this sub-section, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>create a branch in a Subversion repository, and</li>

    <li>update a ticket with a link to a branch.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Further reading:</p>

    <li>FCM Command Reference &gt; <a href=
    "command_ref.html#fcm-branch-create">fcm branch-create</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Create a branch in a Subversion repository</h4>

  <p><strong>Important note: please ensure that your branch is created from
  revision 1 of the trunk here, or the tutorial on merge will fail to work
  later.</strong></p>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm branch-create [-rREV] TICKET
  URL-PROJECT</code> command. (Note: you can write <code>fcm
  branch-create</code> as <code>fcm bcreate</code> or even <code>fcm
  bc</code>.) E.g. if your ticket number is <samp>#133</samp>:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm bc 133 fcm:tutorial@1
</pre>

  <p>You will be prompted to edit the message log file. A standard template is
  automatically supplied for the commit. However, if you want to add extra
  comment for the branch, please do so <strong>above</strong> the line that
  says <samp>--Add your commit message ABOVE - do not alter this line or those
  below--</samp>. When you are ready, save your change and exit the editor.
  Answer <kbd>Yes</kbd> when you are prompted to go ahead and create the
  branch.</p>

  <p>Note: Subversion will prompt you for a password the first time you access
  a repository. The password will normally be cached by the client, and you
  will not have to specify a password on subsequent access.</p>

  <p>When creating branches for the first time, you will notice that FCM will
  create and commit any missing sub-directories it needs to set up your branch
  inside the repository, before creating your branch and commiting it.</p>

  <p>Take a note of the revision number the branch was created at, and its
  branch name. (The revision number is the number following the last output
  that says "Committed revision". In the example above, the branch created at
  <samp>r811</samp> is called <samp>branches/dev/matt/r1_133</samp>, which is a
  branch of the <samp>tutorial</samp> project in the
  <samp>svn://fcm1/tutorial_svn</samp> repository.)</p>

  <h4>Update your ticket with a link to your branch</h4>

  <p>If you wish, you can update your ticket with details of the branch. Note
  that this step is entirely optional. It is useful for developments which will
  take a long time to complete. For short lived branches, this step is probably
  unnecessary.</p>

  <p>In the ticket you have created, refer to the revision number in the
  <kbd>Add/Change</kbd> box, for example:</p>
  <pre>
r811: created source:tutorial/branches/dev/matt/r1_133@811.
</pre>

  <p>Note:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><samp>source:tutorial/branches/dev/matt/r1_133@811</samp> is a Trac
    wiki link. In this syntax, you do not have to put in the root URL, (e.g.
    <samp>svn://fcm1/tutorial_svn/</samp>), but you should specify your branch
    using the project name (<samp>tutorial</samp>), the branch name
    (<samp>branches/dev/matt/r1_133</samp>), and a revision number. Trac will
    translate this into a link to that branch.</li>

    <li>Trac will translate the syntax <code>r&lt;number&gt;</code> or
    <code>[&lt;number&gt;]</code> into a link to the numbered changeset.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Click on <kbd>Preview</kbd> and check that the links work correctly, and
  on <kbd>Submit changes</kbd> when you are ready.</p>

  <h3 id="tutorial_checkout">Checkout a working copy</h3>

  <p><em>A Subversion working copy is an ordinary directory tree on your local
  system, containing a collection of files. It is your private working area in
  which you can make changes before publishing them back to the repository. You
  create a working copy by using the checkout command on some subtree of the
  repository.</em></p>

  <p>After completing this sub-section, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>checkout a Subversion working copy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Further reading:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Code Management System &gt; <a href=
    "code_management.html#svn_concepts">Basic Concepts</a></li>

    <li>FCM Command Reference &gt; <a href="command_ref.html#svn">Other
    Subversion Commands</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Checkout a Subversion working copy</h4>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm checkout</code> (or simply
  <code>fcm co</code>) command. E.g.:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm checkout fcm:tutorial_br/dev/matt/r1_133 tutorial
</pre>

  <ul>
    <li>In the example, we have replaced the leading part of the Subversion URL
    <samp>svn://fcm1/tutorial_svn/tutorial/branches</samp> with the FCM URL
    keyword <samp>fcm:tutorial_br</samp>. This is mainly to save you from
    having to type in the full URL. However, you may find it easier to
    copy-and-paste the full Subversion URL from the output generated when you
    created the branch.</li>

    <li>In the above command, we have asked the system to create a working copy
    in <samp>$PWD/tutorial</samp>. If you do not specify a local directory
    <var>PATH</var> in the <code>checkout</code> command, it will create a
    working copy in the current working directory, using the basename of the
    URL. For example, when you checkout the branch you have just created, the
    command would create the working copy in <samp>$PWD/r1_133</samp>, which is
    often undesirable. Make a note of the location of your working copy, in
    case you forget where you have put it.</li>

    <li>If you do not specify a revision to checkout, it will checkout the
    HEAD, i.e. the latest, revision.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>
=&gt; fcm checkout fcm:tutorial_br/dev/matt/r1_133 tutorial
A    tutorial/doc
A    tutorial/doc/hello.html
A    tutorial/src
A    tutorial/src/subroutine
A    tutorial/src/subroutine/hello_c.c
A    tutorial/src/subroutine/hello_sub.f90
A    tutorial/src/module
A    tutorial/src/module/hello_num.f90
A    tutorial/src/module/hello_constants.f90
A    tutorial/src/program
A    tutorial/src/program/hello.f90
A    tutorial/fcm-make.cfg
Checked out revision 811.
</pre>

  <h3 id="tutorial_change">Make changes to files in your working copy</h3>

  <p><em>Subversion provides various useful commands to help you monitor your
  working copy. The most useful ones are "diff", "revert" and "status". You
  will also find "add", "copy", "delete" and "move" useful when you are
  rearranging your files and directories.</em></p>

  <p>After completing this sub-section, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>make and revert changes,</li>

    <li>add and remove files,</li>

    <li>inspect the status of a working copy, and</li>

    <li>display changes in a working copy.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Further reading:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Code Management System &gt; <a href=
    "code_management.html#svn_basic">Basic Command Line Usage</a></li>

    <li>FCM Command Reference &gt; <a href="command_ref.html#fcm-add">fcm
    add</a>, <a href="command_ref.html#fcm-diff">fcm diff</a>, <a href=
    "command_ref.html#fcm-delete">fcm delete</a>, <a href=
    "command_ref.html#svn">Other Subversion Commands</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Make and revert changes</h4>

  <p>For the later part of the tutorial to work, you must make the following
  modifications:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Change to the <samp>src/module/</samp> sub-directory in your working
    copy.</li>

    <li>Edit <samp>hello_constants.f90</samp>, using your favourite editor, and
    change: <samp>Hello World!</samp> to <kbd>Hello Earthlings!</kbd>. Save
    your change and exit the editor.</li>

    <li>Edit <samp>hello_num.f90</samp> and either add a comment, or make a
    minor code change - for example, use one of :
      <pre>
!This will print a really really big integer.
WRITE(*, *) "Sadly, there's no encoding for Martian base-60"
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Try the following so that you know how to restore a changed file:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Change to the <samp>src/subroutine/</samp> directory of your working
    copy.</li>

    <li>Make a change in file <b>hello_c.c</b>, using your favourite
    editor.</li>

    <li>To see that you have <strong>M</strong>odified this file: issue the
    <code>fcm status</code> command</li>

    <li>Run the <code>revert</code> command to get the file back unmodified:
      <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm revert hello_c.c
</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Add and remove files</h4>

  <p>You may also want to try the following FCM commands in your
  <samp>doc/</samp> sub-directory. You can safely make changes here since they
  will not interfere with your code changes.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>change to the <samp>doc/</samp> directory of your working copy.</li>

    <li>Echo some text into a new file and then run the <code>add</code>
    command, which lets the repository know you're adding a new file at the
    next commit. For example:
      <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ echo 'Some text' &gt;new_file.txt
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm add new_file.txt
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>Make a copy of <samp>hello.html</samp> and remove the original, using
    the <code>copy</code> and <code>delete</code> commands. For example:
      <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm copy hello.html add.html
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm delete hello.html
</pre>
    </li>

    <li>You can use a simple <code>move</code> sub-command for the above
    <code>copy</code> and <code>delete</code>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Inspect the status of a working copy</h4>

  <p>Change to the root directory of your working copy.</p>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm status</code> (or simply
  <code>fcm st</code>) command.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>
=&gt; fcm status
D      doc/hello.html
A      doc/new_file.txt
A  +   doc/add.html
M      src/module/hello_num.f90
M      src/module/hello_constants.f90
</pre>

  <p>This confirms the actions you have taken. You have
  <strong>D</strong>eleted a file, <strong>A</strong>dded a new file,
  <strong>A</strong>dded a file with history (<strong>+</strong>) and
  <strong>M</strong>odified two others. It also confirms the action of the
  <code>revert</code> command.</p>

  <h4>Display changes in a working copy</h4>

  <p>You can view the changes you have made to your working copy.</p>

  <h3 id="tutorial_extract">Test your changes</h3>

  <p><em>You should test the changes in your branch before asking a colleague
  to review them. FCM features a build system that allows you to build your
  code easily. As your changes may be located in a repository branch and/or a
  working copy, you should work with the extract system to extract the correct
  code to build. The extract system allows you to extract code from the
  repository, combining changes in different branches and your working copy,
  before generating a configuration file and a suitable source tree for feeding
  into the build system.</em></p>

  <p><em>In this sub-section of the tutorial, you will be shown how to extract
  and build the code from your branch. (There are some <a href=
  "#tutorial_extra-extract">extra activities on the extract and build
  systems</a> in a later sub-section of the tutorial should you want to explore
  the extract and build systems in more depth.) In the example here, the
  extract and build systems will be shown to you in their simplest form. In
  real life, the managers of the systems you are developing code for will
  provide you with more information on how to extract and build their
  systems.</em></p>

  <p>After completing this sub-section, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>set up a simple FCM make configuration file for extract and build,
    and</li>

    <li>use the <a href="make.html">FCM Make</a> system to perform simple
    extracts and builds.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Further reading:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="make.html">FCM Make</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>You should extract and build your code in a different directory to your
  working copy. For example, you may want to create a sub-directory
  <samp>$HOME/tutorial/test/</samp> and change to it:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ mkdir -p $HOME/tutorial/test
(SHELL PROMPT)$ cd $HOME/tutorial/test
</pre>

  <h4>Set up a FCM make configuration file</h4>

  <p>To set up a FCM make configuration file from scratch, launch your
  favourite editor and add the following lines:</p>
  <pre>
steps = extract build
extract.ns = tutorial
extract.location[tutorial] = branches/dev/$LOGNAME/r1_133
extract.path-root[tutorial] = src
build.target{task} = link
</pre>

  <p>Note:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The <code><a href=
    "annex_cfg.html#make.extract.location">extract.location</a></code>
    declaration is set to <samp>branches/dev/$LOGNAME/r1_133</samp>. If you
    have named your branch differently, you should modify the right hand side
    of the declaration.</li>

    <li>The build system uses <code>gfortran</code> and <code>gcc</code> as the
    default Fortran and C (respectively) compilers. If you do not have these
    compilers installed on your system, you can configure your Fortran and C
    compilers using the <code><a href=
    "annex_cfg.html#make.build.prop.fc">build.prop{fc}</a></code> and
    <code><a href="annex_cfg.html#make.build.prop.cc">build.prop{cc}</a></code>
    declarations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Save the file as <samp>fcm-make.cfg</samp> and exit your editor.</p>

  <h4>Perform an extract and a build</h4>

  <p>Issue the command <code><a href="command_ref.html#fcm-make">fcm
  make</a></code> and you should get an output similar to the following:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm make

</pre>

  <p>If nothing goes wrong, you should end up with the sub-direcories
  <samp>extract/</samp> and <samp>build/</samp> in your working directory. The
  <samp>extract/</samp> sub-directory contains the result of the extract and
  the <samp>build/</samp> sub-directory contains the result of the build.</p>

  <p>N.B. You should also find a <samp>.fcm-make/</samp> sub-directory. It is
  used by <code>fcm make</code> as a working area for your extract and build.
  It also contains a diagnostic <samp>log</samp> file generated by the latest
  <code>fcm make</code> command. The log file contains the diagnostic output in
  high verbosity. If anything goes wrong, it is worth checking the content of
  the log file for clues.</p>

  <p>The executable you have built is <samp>hello.exe</samp>, which is located
  in the <samp>build/bin/</samp> sub-directory. You can test your executable by
  running it. You should get an output similar to the following:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ PATH=$PWD/build/bin:$PATH hello.exe
hello: Hello Earthlings!
hello_sub: Hello Earthlings!
hello_huge_number: maximum integer: 2147483647
hello_c: Hello World!
</pre>

  <h3 id="tutorial_merge">Merge changes from the trunk and resolve
  conflicts</h3>

  <p><em>Your branch is normally isolated from other development lines in your
  project. However, at some point during your development, you may need to
  merge your changes with those of your colleagues. In some cases, it is
  desirable to merge changes regularly from the trunk to keep your branch up to
  date with the latest development. The automatic merge provided by FCM allows
  you to do this easily.</em></p>

  <p><em>A merge results in a conflict if changes being applied to a file
  overlap. FCM uses a graphical merge tool to help you resolve overlaps in file
  text changes (</em>text conflicts<em>). If some of the changes include a
  deletion, renaming, or addition of the file, a filesystem conflict (</em>tree
  conflict<em>) may occur, which needs to be dealt with manually.</em></p>

  <p>After completing this sub-section, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>merge changes from the trunk into your working copy, and</li>

    <li>resolve text and tree conflicts in your working copy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Merge changes from the trunk into a working copy</h4>

  <p>Perform the merge in your working copy.</p>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm merge</code> command.
  E.g.</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm merge trunk
</pre>

  <p>If there is more than one revision of the source that you can merge with,
  you will be prompted for the revision number you wish to merge from. You will
  not be prompted in this case, because there is only one revision of the
  source that you can merge with.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>
Eligible merge(s) from /tutorial/trunk: 2
Merge: /tutorial/trunk@2
 c.f.: /tutorial/trunk@1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------dry-run
--- Merging r2 into '.':
U    src/subroutine/hello_c.c
A    src/module/hello_number.f90
C    src/module/hello_constants.f90
   C src/module/hello_num.f90
Summary of conflicts:
  Text conflicts: 1
  Tree conflicts: 1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------dry-run
Would you like to go ahead with the merge?
Enter "y" or "n" (or just press &lt;return&gt; for "n"): y
Merge succeeded.
</pre>

  <h4>Status of the working copy after a merge</h4>

  <p>In the output of the merge, the <samp>C</samp> status at the beginning of
  a line indicates that the first file you changed,
  <samp>src/module/hello_constants.f90</samp>, is now in <em>text
  conflict</em>. The <samp>C</samp> status in the 4th column of a line
  indicates that the second file you changed,
  <samp>src/subroutines/hello_num.f90</samp>, is now in <em>tree conflict</em>.
  If you run <code>fcm status</code>, you will see extra information about the
  merge, which may help you to resolve the conflicts:</p>
  <pre>
=&gt; fcm status
 M      .
?       #commit_message#
M       src/subroutine/hello_c.c
?       src/module/hello_constants.f90.merge-left.r1
?       src/module/hello_constants.f90.merge-right.r2
?       src/module/hello_constants.f90.working
      C src/module/hello_num.f90
      &gt;   local edit, incoming delete upon merge
A  +    src/module/hello_number.f90
C       src/module/hello_constants.f90
</pre>

  <p>In the case of the file <samp>hello_constants.f90</samp>, the extra files
  created (ending with <samp>working</samp>, <samp>merge-left.r1</samp>,
  <samp>merge-right.r2</samp>) will be used to resolve the text conflict using
  the 3-way difference tool <code>xxdiff</code>.</p>

  <p>In the case of the file <samp>hello_num.f90</samp>, the extra line
  underneath (<em>local edit, incoming delete upon merge</em>) displays the
  conflict or dilemma that you must resolve - you have made a change to the
  file in your branch (<em>local edit</em>) but someone has deleted the file on
  the trunk (<em>incoming delete upon merge</em>). If you inspect the log of
  the trunk, by typing e.g. <code>fcm log -v -rHEAD:1
  fcm:tutorial/trunk</code>, you will find that someone has renamed
  <samp>src/module/hello_num.f90</samp> to
  <samp>src/module/hello_number.f90</samp>.</p>

  <p>The line: <samp>M .</samp> just refers to Subversion's merge tracking,
  which is not relevant here.</p>

  <p>You will now have to resolve the conflicts.</p>

  <h4>Resolve the conflicts</h4>

  <p>Issue the <code>fcm conflicts</code> (or simply <code>fcm cf</code>)
  command.</p>

  <p>The <code>xxdiff</code> program comes into play:</p>

  <p class="image"><img src="xxdiff_tutorial.png" alt="3-way diff" /></p>

  <p>See the sub-section on <a href=
  "code_management.html#svn_basic_conflicts">resolving conflicts</a>, or the
  <cite>xxdiff User's Manual</cite> (click on <em>Help</em>) to guide you
  through this process. (If you do not want to learn how to use
  <code>xxdiff</code> now, you can just click on the highlighted line in the
  left hand column, and select <kbd>Exit with MERGED</kbd> from the
  <em>File</em> menu. This saves the file you are merging in as the result of
  the merge, i.e. you have <em>merged</em> the changes).</p>

  <p>On resolving this conflict, you will be asked to run <code>svn
  resolved</code>. Answer <kbd>Yes</kbd>.</p>

  <p>You are now prompted to try to solve the <em>tree conflict</em>.</p>
  <pre>
[info] src/module/hello_num.f90: in tree conflict.
Locally: modified
Externally: renamed to src/module/hello_number.f90
Answer (y) to keep the old name.
Answer (n) to accept the rename.
You can then merge in changes.
Keep the local version?
Enter "y" or "n" (or just press &lt;return&gt; for "n") 
</pre>

  <p>Entering <samp>y</samp> will keep the file as it is, and entering
  <samp>n</samp> will accept the external changes. Your problem is that the
  edit you made to <samp>hello_num.f90</samp> is no longer valid on the trunk,
  because there the file has been renamed to <samp>hello_number.f90</samp>. To
  Subversion, it looks like <samp>hello_num.f90</samp> disappeared. Your
  choices would be either to delete the new file by answering <samp>y</samp>,
  or incorporate your changes into the new file (<samp>hello_number.f90</samp>)
  by answering <samp>n</samp>. As the new filename comes from the trunk, we
  would normally accept it and incorporate changes into it, rather than delete
  it.</p>

  <p>Answer <samp>n</samp> to accept the renaming of the file and merge in
  changes. This will occur using <code>xxdiff</code>, as above.</p>

  <p>Exit the <code>xxdiff</code> window as before, with <kbd>Exit with
  MERGED</kbd>.</p>

  <p>If you now run <code>status</code>, you will notice that these extra
  conflict files have disappeared, and there are no more <samp>C</samp>
  filename statuses.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>
=&gt; fcm status
 M      .
?       #commit_message#
M       src/subroutine/hello_c.c
D       src/module/hello_num.f90
A  +    src/module/hello_number.f90
</pre>

  <p>You have now resolved all the conflicts.</p>

  <h4>Commit after the merge</h4>

  <p>It is important to remember that the <code>fcm merge</code> command only
  applies changes to your working copy. Therefore, you must now commit the
  change in order for it to become permanent in the repository. Similar to
  other changes, it is a good practice to use <code>fcm diff</code> to inspect
  the changes before committing.</p>

  <p>When you run <code>fcm commit</code>, you will be prompted to edit the
  commit log as usual. However, you may notice that a standard template is
  already provided for you by the <code>fcm merge</code> command. In most
  cases, the standard message should be sufficient. However, if you want to add
  extra comment to the commit, please do so <strong>above</strong> the line
  that says <samp>--Add your commit message ABOVE - do not alter this line or
  those below--</samp>. This is useful, for example, if there were significant
  issues addressed in the merge.</p>

  <h3 id="tutorial_review-ticket">Review changes</h3>

  <p><em>For the purpose of this tutorial, we assume that your changes are
  complete, have been tested and committed to the repository, and are now ready
  for review. You should assign the ticket to the reviewer and inform him/her
  where to find the changes you wish him/her to review. The reviewer will
  record any issues in the ticket, perhaps linking to other documents as
  required. Once completed, he/she will record the outcome in the ticket and
  assign it back to the you.</em></p>

  <p>After completing this sub-section, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>display changes in a branch, and</li>

    <li>re-assign a ticket.</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>

  <h4>Display changes in a branch</h4>

  <p>Before you ask someone to review your code, it is often a good idea to
  have a look at the changes one more time. To view the changes in a branch,
  you can look at all the changes relative to its base.</p>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm branch-diff
  --graphical</code> (or simply <code>fcm bdi -g</code>) command.</p>

  <p>You should be presented with the differences between the branch and the
  trunk (since the last merge).</p>

  <p>Note: you can also use the <code>--trac</code> (<code>-t</code>) option
  instead of <code>--graphical</code> (<code>-g</code>) to view the changes in
  a branch using Trac rather than using a graphical diff tool.</p>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm branch-diff --trac</code> (or
  simply <code>fcm bdi -t</code>) command.</p>

  <p>Take note of the Trac URL for displaying the differences. The part that
  begins with <code>diff:</code> is of particular interest to you, as it is a
  Trac link that can be inserted into a Trac wiki/ticket. In the above example,
  the Trac link would look like:
  <samp>diff:/tutorial/trunk@2///tutorial/branches/dev/matt/r1_133@813</samp>.</p>

  <h4>Re-assign a ticket to a reviewer</h4>

  <p>Back in your ticket, add an appropriate comment showing where to find your
  changes, in the <em>Add/Change</em> box. Include a link to your branch and a
  diff link (see above) in the comment. For example:</p>
  <pre>
The [log:tutorial/branches/dev/matt/r1_133@811:813] branch proposes
changes to the greeting in hello_constants.f90. It also contains some new
documents. See
[diff:/tutorial/trunk@2///tutorial/branches/dev/matt/r1_133@813] for the
changes.

Fred, could you review the change, please?
</pre>

  <p>Note: the syntax
  <samp>[log:tutorial/branches/dev/matt/r1_133@811:813]</samp> will be
  translated by Trac into a link to the revision log browser to display the log
  between revision 811 and 813 of the <samp>branches/dev/matt/r1_133</samp>
  branch in the <samp>tutorial</samp> project; and the syntax
  <samp>[diff:/tutorial/trunk@2///tutorial/branches/dev/matt/r1_133@813]</samp>
  will be translated into a link to display the differences between the trunk
  at revision 2 and the branch at revision 813. Click on <kbd>Preview</kbd> and
  check that the links work correctly.</p>

  <p>To re-assign a ticket to your reviewer, click on the <kbd>reassign
  to</kbd> button in the <em>Action</em> box section and enter the reviewer's
  User ID.</p>

  <p>When you are ready, click on <kbd>Submit changes</kbd>.</p>

  <h4>Reassign the ticket back to the author</h4>

  <p>For the purpose of this tutorial, you will act as the reviewer of the
  changes you have made. Following the review, you should record its outcome
  and re-assign the ticket back to the author. Enter the comment <kbd>No issues
  were found during the review</kbd>. Click on the <kbd>reassign to</kbd>
  button in the <em>Action</em> box section, and enter your guest account name.
  Click on <kbd>Submit changes</kbd> when you are ready.</p>

  <h3 id="tutorial_merge-back">Commit to the trunk</h3>

  <p><em>Your changes in the branch have been tested and reviewed. It is now
  time to merge and commit it to the trunk. Once you have committed your
  change, you will close your ticket to complete the work cycle.</em></p>

  <p>After completing this sub-section, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>switch a working copy,</li>

    <li>merge and commit your changes into the trunk, and</li>

    <li>close a ticket</li>
  </ul>

  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm sw trunk
</pre>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: To check that your working copy is pointing to

  <h4>Merge and commit your changes into the trunk</h4>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm merge</code> command.
  E.g.</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm merge branches/dev/matt/r1_133
</pre>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>
Eligible merge(s) from /tutorial/branches/dev/matt/r1_133: 813 812
Enter a revision (or just press &lt;return&gt; for "813"):

</pre>

  <p>Since there is more than one revision available for merging, you will be
  prompted for the revision number you wish to merge from. The default is the
  last changed revision of your branch. which is the revision you want to merge
  with, so you should just proceed with the default.</p>

  <p>Since we merged in the latest changes from the trunk into the branch,
  there should be no conflicts from this merge.</p>

  <p>Once again, please remember that the merge command only changes your
  working copy. You need to commit the change before it becomes permanent in
  the repository. Before you commit to the trunk, however, it is often sensible
  to have a last look at what you are going to change using the
  <code>diff</code> command.</p>

  <p>Note: We have set up the repository to prevent any commits to the trunk to
  preserve the tutorial for other users, so your commit to the trunk will fail.
  However, you should try doing it any way to complete the exercise.</p>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm commit</code> (or simply
  <code>fcm ci</code>) command.</p>

  <p>A text editor will appear to allow you to edit the commit message. You
  must add a commit message to describe your change <strong>above</strong> the
  line that says <samp>--Add your commit message ABOVE - do not alter this line
  or those below--</samp>. Since you are going to commit changes to the trunk,
  you should provide a useful message, including a link to your ticket. For
  example:</p>
  <pre>
#133: tutorial completed.
</pre>

  <p>When you are ready, save your change and exit the editor.</p>

  <p>As we have said before, the command will fail when you try to proceed with
  the commit.</p>

  <h4>Close your ticket</h4>

  <p>As you have completed your work, you should now update and close your
  ticket. In real life, you will typically include a closing comment with an
  appropriate Trac wiki link to the changeset in the trunk that fixes the
  ticket.</p>

  <p>Since you cannot commit to the trunk in the tutorial, you can include a
  Trac link to the latest changeset in your branch. For example, you can put
  <samp>r813: fixed.</samp> in the comment. To mark the ticket as
  <em>fixed</em>, move down to the <em>Action</em> box section, click on
  <kbd>resolve as</kbd> and choose <kbd>fixed</kbd>. Use <kbd>Preview</kbd> to
  ensure that your links work correctly. When you are happy, click on
  <kbd>Submit changes</kbd>.</p>

  <h3 id="tutorial_extra-extract">Extra activities on the extract and build
  systems</h3>

  <p><em>The extract and build systems are very flexible. If you have time, you
  may want to explore their uses in more depth.</em></p>

  <p>After completing this sub-section, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>extract from a working copy,</li>

    <li>change a compiler flag, and</li>

    <li>extract from a particular branch and/or revision from the
    repository.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Further reading:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="make.html">FCM Make</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Extract from a working copy</h4>

  <p>Modify the source files in your working copy and commit the changes back
  to your branch in the repository. Re-run <code><a href=
  "command_ref.html#fcm-make">fcm make</a></code> and see the results of the
  changes.</p>

  <p>In fact, you can test changes in your working copy directly using a
  similar extract and build mechanism. In such case, you need to modify the
  <code><a href=
  "annex_cfg.html#make.extract.location">extract.location</a></code>
  declaration. For example:</p>
  <pre>
extract.location[tutorial] = $HOME/work/tutorial
</pre>

  <h4>Change a compiler flag</h4>

  <p>Modify the compiler flags, and re-run <code><a href=
  "command_ref.html#fcm-make">fcm make</a></code> and see the results of the
  changes. To modify the compiler flags, edit your FCM make configuration file,
  and add the declarations for changing compiler flags. For example:</p>
  <pre>
# Declare extra options for Fortran compiler
build.prop{fc.flags} = -i8 -O3
</pre>

  <p>For further information on how to set your compiler flags, please refer to
  the <a href="make.html">FCM Make</a> &gt; <a href=
  "make.html#build">Build</a>.</p>

  <h4>Extract from a particular branch and/or revision</h4>

  <p>Try extracting from an earlier revision of your branch. Suppose the HEAD
  of your branch is revision 813, and the branch was created at an earlier
  revision. You can extract your branch at, say, revision 811 by adding the
  following to the <code><a href=
  "annex_cfg.html#make.extract.location">extract.location</a></code>
  declaration in your FCM make configuration file:</p>
  <pre>
extract.location[tutorial] = branches/dev/$LOGNAME/r1_133@811
</pre>

  <p>You can also try extracting from the trunk. To extract from the
  <samp>trunk@HEAD</samp>, simply comment out or remove the <code><a href=
  "annex_cfg.html#make.extract.location">extract.location</a></code>
  declaration. To extract from a given revision of the trunk, you will need to
  modify the <code><a href=
  "annex_cfg.html#make.extract.location">extract.location</a></code>
  declaration in your FCM make configuration file. For example:</p>
  <pre>
extract.location[tutorial] = trunk@1
</pre>

  <h3 id="tutorial_delete-branch">Delete your branch</h3>

  <p><em>You should remove your branch when it is no longer required. When you
  remove it, it becomes invisible from the HEAD revision, but will continue to
  exist in the repository, should you want to refer to it in the
  future.</em></p>

  <p>After completing this sub-section, you will learn how to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>list branches owned by you, and</li>

    <li>delete a branch.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Further reading:</p>

  <ul>

    or Other Users</a></li>

    <li>Code Management System &gt; Branching &amp; Merging &gt; <a href=
    "code_management.html#svn_branching_delete">Deleting Branches</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>List branches owned by you</h4>

  <p>If you forget what your branch is called and/or what other branches you
  have created, you can get a listing of all the branches you have created in a
  project.</p>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm branch-list</code> (or simply
  <code>fcm bls</code>) command</p>

  <h4>Delete a branch</h4>

  <p>Switch your working copy to point back to your branch. Before you do so,
  revert any changes you have made in the working copy by issuing the <code>fcm
  revert -R .</code> command. If a <samp>#commit_message#</samp> file exists,
  remove it by issuing the <code>rm '#commit_message#'</code> command.</p>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm switch &lt;URL&gt;</code> (or
  simply <code>fcm sw &lt;URL&gt;</code>) command.</p>

  <p>You can continue your work in the branch if you wish, but once you have
  finished all the work, you should delete it.</p>

  <p><dfn>Command line</dfn>: issue the <code>fcm branch-delete</code> (or
  simply <code>fcm bdel</code>) command.</p>

  <p>You will be prompted to edit the commit message file. A standard template
  is automatically supplied for the commit. However, if you want to add extra
  comment for the branch, please do so <strong>above</strong> the line that
  says <samp>--Add your commit message ABOVE - do not alter this line or those
  below--</samp>. Save your change and exit the editor.</p>

  <p>Your working copy is now pointing to a branch that no longer exists at the
  HEAD revision of the repository. If you want to try the tutorial again, you
  may want to create another branch, and switch your working copy to point to
  the new branch. Otherwise, you can remove your working copy by issuing a
  careful <code>rm -rf</code> command.</p>

  <h3 id="tutorial_delete-final-comments">Final comments</h3>

  <p>We have guided you through the basics of the complete change process,
  using recommended ways of working. Most of the basic and important commands
  have been covered by the tutorial. (The exceptions are <code>fcm log</code>
  and <code>fcm update</code>, which you may have to use regularly. For
  information on these commands, please refer to the section on <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.tour.history.html#svn.tour.history.log">
  svn log</a> and <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.update">
  Update Your Working Copy</a> in the <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/">Subversion book</a>.) You should now be
  in a position to continue with your development work with FCM. However, if at
  any time you are unsure about any aspect of using FCM, please consult the
  relevant section of the <a href="index.html">FCM User Guide</a>.</p>

  <p>Feel free to use the tutorial, at any time, for testing out any aspect of
  the system. You may wish to do this rather than use your own repository and
  ticket system, to avoid cluttering them with unwanted junk.</p>
