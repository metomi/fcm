  <p>The FCM system is designed to simplify the task of managing and building
  source code. It consists of the following components:</p>

  <h2 id="code-management">Code Management</h2>

  <p>FCM uses <a href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> for
  version control. For a summary of its main features please refer to the
  <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">Version Control with
  Subversion</a> book. Subversion is a generalised tool which can be used
  in lots of different ways. This makes some day-to-day tasks more complex
  than they need be. FCM defines a simplified process and appropriate
  naming conventions. It then adds a layer on top of Subversion to provide
  a natural interface which is specifically tailored to this process. Where
  appropriate it simply makes use of the command line tools provided by
  Subversion. However, in other cases it provides significant additional
  functionality, e.g.:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>By making some assumptions about the repository layout (i.e. by
    imposing a standard working practice) FCM simplifies the task of
    creating branches and enforces a standard branch naming
    convention.</li>

    <li>Having defined working practices and standard log messages allows
    FCM to greatly simplify the process of merging changes between
    branches.</li>

    <li>FCM makes use of <a href="http://furius.ca/xxdiff/">xxdiff</a> (a
    graphical diff and merge tool) to allow users to easily examine changes
    they have made and to simplify the process of resolving any conflicts
    which result from a merge.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>FCM uses <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>, a powerful web
  based tool, to manage software projects. <a href=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a> has the following features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>A flexible issue tracker which can be used to keep track of bugs,
    feature requests, etc. Each issue (known as a <q title=
    "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracTickets">ticket</q> within Trac) can
    be given a priority and assigned to a particular person. Changes made
    to your Subversion repository can easily be traced to the relevant
    ticket. Where appropriate, tickets can be used to record information
    about who has reviewed each change.</li>

    <li>A <q title="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracRoadmap">roadmap</q>
    feature which helps you to plan and manage project releases. Each
    ticket can be associated with a particular milestone. Trac can then
    easily show you what features or fixes went into a particular release
    or what work remains before a particular milestone is reached.</li>

    <li>A <q title="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracWiki">wiki</q> which
    can be used for project documentation.</li>

    <li>A browser for viewing your Subversion repository which allows you
    to browse the project tree / files and examine revision logs and
    changesets.</li>

    <li>A timeline view which summarises all the activity on a project
    (changes to the tickets, wiki pages or the Subversion repository).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="build-and-extract">Build and Extract</h2>

  <p>FCM features a powerful build system, mainly aimed at building modern
  Fortran software applications. It has the following features:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Parallel build.</li>

    <li>Efficient incremental build. Changes to the checksums of source files
    and/or the build configuration (e.g. changes to the compiler flags) trigger
    the appropriate re-compilation.</li>

    <li>Inheritance of items from an existing build.</li>

    <li>Build dependency analysis.</li>

    <li>Automatic generation of include files to contain the calling
    interfaces of standalone functions and subroutinues in Fortran source
    files.</li>

    <li>Extract of source files from multiple repositories and working
    copies.</li>

    <li>Extract and merge of source files from different branches of
    development.</li>

    <li>Minimal configuration.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The diagram below illustrates how these components fit together.</p>
