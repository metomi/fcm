  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

  <p>This chapter provides an administration guide for managers of projects or
  systems which are using FCM.</p>

  <p>Note that, where this section refers to the <em>FCM team</em> this applies
  only to Met Office users. Users at other sites will either need to refer to the
  equivalent team within their organisation or will need to perfom these tasks
  themselves.</p>

  <h2 id="svn">Subversion</h2>

  <h3 id="svn_layout">Repository Layout</h3>

  <p>In theory you can set up your repository to have any random layouts.
  However, many <code>fcm</code> commands have to make assumptions on a set of
  working practices in order to function. The easiest way is to go with the
  default:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;root&gt;
    |
    |-- &lt;project 1&gt;
    |       |
    |       |-- trunk
    |       |-- branches
    |       |-- tags
    |
    |-- &lt;project 2&gt;
    |       |
    |       |-- trunk
    |       |-- branches
    |       |-- tags
    |
    |-- ...
</pre>
  
  <p>In the default layout, each project is a sub-directory under the repository
  root. Each project has a <code>trunk</code> sub-directory, and optionally a
  <code>branches</code> sub-directory and a <code>tags</code> sub-directory. The
  main line of development of the project lives directly under the
  <code>trunk</code> sub-directory. A branch lives 3 levels under the
  <code>branches</code> sub-directory. A tag lives 1 level under the
  <code>tags</code> sub-directory.</p>

  <p>FCM allows you to customise the layout for each repository by adding an
  <code>fcm:layout</code> property at the HEAD of root of the repository.
  E.g.:</p>

  <pre>
(shell prompt)$ fcm co -q -N svn://host/repos repos-root
(shell prompt)$ cd repos-root
(shell prompt)$ fcm pe fcm:layout .
</pre>

  <p>The default settings are given in the following. In the editor started by
  <code>fcm pe</code>, add these settings and modify the VALUE of each KEY=VALUE
  pair.</p>

  <pre>
depth-project =
depth-branch = 3
depth-tag = 1
dir-trunk = trunk
dir-branch = branches
dir-tag = tags
level-owner-branch = 2
level-owner-tag =
template-branch = {category}/{owner}/{name_prefix}{name}
template-tag =
</pre>

  <p>The settings will become effective when you <code>fcm commit</code> them.
  An empty VALUE denotes an undefined value. The meanings of the settings are
  described below:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>depth-project</code></dt>

    <dd>Number of sub-directories expected to be used by the name of a project.
    An undefined value means that a project can live under an
    arbitrary number of sub-directories (or directly) below the repository
    root.</dd>

    <dt><code>depth-branch</code></dt>

    <dd>Number of sub-directories (under the sub-directory defined by
    <code>dir-branch</code>) expected to be used by the name of a branch. This
    setting must be defined.</dd>

    <dt><code>depth-tag</code></dt>

    <dd>Number of sub-directories (under the sub-directory defined by
    <code>dir-tag</code>) expected to be used by the name of a tag. This
    setting must be defined.</dd>

    <dt><code>dir-trunk</code></dt>

    <dd>The sub-directory (under the project) where the trunk source tree lives.
    This setting must be defined.</dd>

    <dt><code>dir-branch</code></dt>

    <dd>The sub-directory (under the project) where (the sub-directories
    containing) all the branch source trees live.</dd>

    <dt><code>dir-tag</code></dt>

    <dd>The sub-directory (under the project) where (the sub-directories
    containing) all the tag source trees live.</dd>

    <dt><code>level-owner-branch</code></dt>

    <dd>The sub-directory level in the name of a branch containing its owner.</dd>

    <dt><code>level-owner-tag</code></dt>

    <dd>The sub-directory level in the name of a tag containing its owner.</dd>

    <dt><code>template-branch</code></dt>

    <dd>The template string to construct a branch name.</dd>

    <dt><code>template-tag</code></dt>

    <dd>The template string to construct a tag name.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>You will need to decide whether to use a single project tree for your
  system or whether to use multiple projects.</p>

  <p>Advantages of a single project tree:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Changes to any part of the system can always be committed as a single
    logical changeset. If you split your system into multiple projects then you
    may have occasions when a logical change involves more than one project and
    hence requires multiple commits (and branches).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Disadvantages of a single project tree:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If you have a large system then your working copies may become very
    large and unwieldy. Basic commands such as <code>checkout</code> and
    <code>status</code> can become frustratingly slow if your working copy is
    too large.</li>

    <li>Depending on how you work, you may end up doing lots more merges of
    files that are unrelated to your work.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>One common approach is to split the admin type files (e.g. site
  configurations that are unrelated to the main release) into a separate project
  from the core system files. If you include any large data files under version
  control you may also want to use a separate project for them to avoid making
  your working copies very large when editing code.</p>

  <p>Note that there is often no obvious right or wrong answer so you just have
  to make a decision and see how it works out. You can always re-arrange your
  repository in the future (although be aware that this will break any changes
  being prepared on branches at the time).</p>

  <p>You also need to decide whether your system requires its own repository
  (or multiple repositories) or whether it can share with another system.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The main disadvantage of having separate repositories for each system
    is the maintenance overhead (although this is almost all automated by the
    FCM team so is not a big deal).</li>

    <li>We normally configure a single Trac environment per repository. If the
    repository contains multiple systems then it makes it difficult to use the
    Trac milestones to handle system releases. However, Trac now supports
    restricting itself to a sub-directory within a repository so, again, this
    is not a big deal.</li>

    <li>If you share a repository with other systems then your revision numbers
    can increase even when there are no changes to your system. This doesn't
    matter but some people don't like it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For simplicity, in most cases you will probably want your own repository
  for your system.</p>

  <p>You will not normally want to have multiple repositories for a system. One
  exception may be if you are storing large data files where you might not want
  to keep all the old versions for ever. Removing old versions can't be done
  without changing all the revision numbers which would mess up all your code
  history and Trac tickets. Storing the large data files in a separate
  repository reduces the impact if you do decide to remove old versions in the
  future. One disadvantage of this approach is that, for the moment at least,
  Trac only handles one repository so you will need a separate Trac environment for
  the data files.</p>

  <p>For further details please see the section <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout">
  Planning Your Repository Organization</a> from the Subversion book.</p>

  <h3 id="svn_create">Creating a Repository</h3>

  <p>Normally the FCM team will help you to set up your initial repository.
  However, it is quite simple if you need to do it yourself. First you need to
  issue the command <code>svnadmin create /path/to/repos</code>. This creates an
  empty repository which is now ready to accept an initial import. To do so, you
  should create a directory tree in a suitable location, and issue the <code>fcm
  project-create</code> command. At the root of the repository should be the
  project directories. Each project should then contain the <samp>trunk</samp>
  sub-directory.  The sub-directories <samp>branches</samp> and
  <samp>tags</samp> are optional.  You can import your source files to the
  <samp>trunk</samp> after the project is created. For example, if your
  directory tree is located at <samp>$HOME/foo</samp>, you will do the following
  to import it to a new repository:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ svnadmin create FOO_svn
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm project-create FOO file://$PWD/FOO_svn
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm checkout file://$PWD/FOO_svn/FOO $HOME/svn-wc/foo
(SHELL PROMPT)$ cd $HOME/svn-wc/foo
(SHELL PROMPT)$ cp -r $HOME/foo/* .
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm add *
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm status
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm commit
</pre>

  <p>Note that the <code>svnadmin</code> command takes a <var>PATH</var> as an
  argument, as opposed to a URL for the <code>svn</code> command.</p>

  <p>For further details please see the section <a href=
  "http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout">
  Planning Your Repository Organization</a> from the Subversion book.</p>

  <h3 id="svn_access">Access Control</h3>

  <p>Restrictions such as preventing anonymous read access or restricting write
  access to the trunk to a limited set of users can be arranged if
  necessary.</p>

  <h3 id="svn_hosting">Repository Hosting</h3>

  <p>The FCM team will organise the hosting of your repository. A number of
  facilities will be set up for you as standard.</p>

  <p>Your repository will be set up on a central FCM server and access will be
  provided via <code>svnserve</code> (which we use in preference to
  <cite>Apache</cite> for performance reasons). The FCM team will advise you of
  the URL, and put in place standard hook scripts and backup procedures.</p>

  <p>Note that if you want to use a Subversion repository for your own
  individual use there is no need to get the FCM team to host it. You can
  simply create your repository and then use a <code>file://</code> URL to
  access it.</p>

  <h2 id="trac">Trac</h2>

  <h3 id="trac_config">Trac Configuration</h3>

  <p>Normally the FCM team will set up your Trac environment for you. This
  section describes some things you may wish to be configured. This can be done
  when the Trac environment is set up or later if you are unsure what you will
  require at first.</p>

  <h4 id="trac_access">Access Control</h4>

  <p>You will not normally want to allow anonymous users to make changes to
  your Trac environment since this means that changes may not get identified with a
  userid. The FCM team will normally set up your Trac environment such that any
  authenticated users can make changes. Further restrictions such as
  restricting write access to named accounts or preventing anonymous read
  access can be arranged if necessary.</p>

  <p>The system manager will normally be given <var>TRAC_ADMIN</var>
  privileges. This allows them to do additional things which normal users
  cannot do such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Delete wiki pages (the latest version or the entire page).</li>

    <li>Add or modify milestones, components and versions.</li>

    <li>Modify ticket descriptions and delete ticket attachments.</li>

    <li>Make wiki pages read-only.</li>

    <li>Alter the permissions.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For further details please see the section <a href=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracPermissions">Trac Permissions</a> from the
  Trac documentation.</p>

  <h4 id="trac_email">Email Notification</h4>

  <p>By default, each Trac environment is configured such that the owner and
  reporter and anyone on the <var>CC</var> list are notified whenever a change
  is made to a ticket. If system mangers wish to be notified of all ticket
  changes then this can also be configured. Alternatively, email notifications
  can be disabled if they are not wanted.</p>

  <h4 id="trac_misc">Other Configurable Items</h4>

  <p>There are lots of other things that can be configured in your Trac
  environment
  such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Custom fields</li>

    <li>System icon</li>

    <li>Stylesheets</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For further details please see the sections <a href=
  "http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracIni">The Trac Configuration File</a> and
  <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracTickets">The Trac Ticket
  System</a> from the Trac documentation.</p>

  <h3 id="trac_hosting">Trac Hosting</h3>

  <p>The FCM team will organise the hosting of your Trac environment. It will be set
  up on the same server that hosts your Subversion repository and access will
  be provided via a web server. The FCM team will advise you of the URL, and put
  in place the backup procedures.</p>

  <h2 id="fcm-keywords">FCM Keywords</h2>

  <p>When you set up a repository for a new project, you will normally want the
  FCM team to set up a URL keyword for it in the FCM central configuration
  file. The name of the project should be a short string containing only word
  characters.</p>

  <p>Individual projects can store revision keywords using the Subversion
  property <code>fcm:revision</code> at registered URLs. Using the UM as an
  example: if <samp>UM</samp> is a registered URL keyword, you can add the
  <code>fcm:revision</code> property at the head of the UM project by doing a
  non-recursive checkout. E.g.:</p>
  <pre>
(prompt)$ fcm co -q -N fcm:um um
(prompt)$ fcm pe fcm:revision um
</pre>

  <p>In the editor, add the following and <code>fcm commit</code>:</p>
  <pre>
vn6.3 = 402
vn6.4 = 1396
vn6.5 = 2599
vn6.6 = 4913
vn7.0 = 6163
</pre>

  <p>In a subsequent invocation of <code>fcm</code>, if a revision keyword is
  specified for a URL in the UM namespace, the command will attempt to load it
  from the <code>fcm:revision</code> property at the head of the UM project.
  Revision keywords can also be defined in the FCM central configuration file
  if you prefer.</p>

  <p>If the project has an associated Trac browser, you can also declare
  browser URL mapping in the central configuration file. This allows FCM to
  associate the Subversion URL with a Trac browser URL. There is an automatic
  default for mapping URLs hosted by the FCM team at the Met Office. External
  users of FCM may want to adjust this default for their site.</p>

  <p>To change the default browser URL mapping, you need to make some
  <code>browser.*[namespace] = value</code> declarations in your site's
  <samp>$FCM/etc/fcm/keyword.cfg</samp> file. There are 3 components to this
  declaration: <var>browser.comp-pat</var>, <var>browser.loc-tmpl</var> and
  <var>browser.rev-tmpl</var>. The <var>browser.comp-pat</var> is a regular
  expression, which is used to separate the scheme-specific part of a version
  control system URL into a number of components by capturing its substrings.
  These components are then used to fill in the numbered fields in the
  <var>browser.loc-tmpl</var>. The template should have one more field than the
  number of components captured by <var>browser.comp-pat</var>. The last field
  is used to place the revision, which is generated via the
  <var>browser.rev-tmpl</var>. This template should have a single numbered
  field for filling in the revision number. This is best demonstrated by an
  example. Consider the declarations:</p>
  <pre>
browser.comp-pat = (?msx-i:\A//([^/]+)/(.*)\z)
browser.loc-tmpl = http://{1}/intertrac/source:{2}{3}
browser.rev-tmpl = @{1}
</pre>

  <p>If we have a Subversion URL <samp>svn://repos/path/to/a/file</samp>, the
  <var>browser.comp-pat</var> will capture the components [<samp>repos</samp>,
  <samp>path/to/a/file</samp>]. When this is applied to the
  <code>browser.loc-tmpl</code>, <var>{1}</var> will be translated to
  <samp>repos</samp> and <var>{2}</var> will be translated to
  <samp>path/to/a/file</samp>. A revision is not given in this case, and so
  <var>{3}</var> is inserted with an empty string. The result is
  <samp>http://repos/intertrac/path/to/a/file</samp>. If the revision is
  <samp>1357</samp>, the <var>browser.rev-tmpl</var> will be used to translate
  it to <samp>@1357</samp>, which is then inserted to <var>{3}</var> of the
  <var>browser.loc-tmpl</var>. The result is therefore
  <samp>http://repos/intertrac/path/to/a/file@1357</samp>.</p>

  <p>For more information on how to set up the keywords, please refer to
  <a href="code_management.html#svn_basic_keywords">Repository &amp; Revision
  Keywords</a> and the <a href="annex_cfg.html">Annex: FCM Configuration
  File</a>.</p>

  <h2 id="make-cfg">FCM Make Configuration</h2>

  <p>The <code>fcm make</code> command (for invoking the extract and build
  systems) is very flexibile and can be used in lots of different ways. It is
  therefore difficult to give specific advice explaining how to configure them.
  However, based on experience with a number of systems, the following general
  advice can be offered.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Standard FCM Make configuration files should be defined and stored
    within the repository. Users then include these files into their
    configurations, before applying their local changes.</li>

    <li>The files should be designed to include one another in a hierarchy. For
    example, you may have one core file which defines all the repository and
    source locations plus a series of platform/compiler specific files which
    include the core file. More complex setups are also possible if you need to
    cater for other options such as different optimisation levels, 32/64 bit,
    etc.</li>

    <li>When including other configuration files, always make use of the
    special <var>$HERE</var> variable (rather than, for instance, referring to
    a fixed repository location). When your configuration file is parsed, this
    special variable is normally expanded into the container directory of the
    current configuration file. This means that the include statements should
    work correctly whether you are referring to configuration files in the
    repository trunk, in a branch or in a local working copy.</li>

    <li>Make good use of variables (e.g. <samp>$name_spaces</samp>) to simplify
    repetitive declarations and make your configuration files easier to
    maintain.</li>

    <li>Use continuation lines to split long lines and make them easier to
    read.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Probably the best advice is to look at what has already been set up for
  other systems. The FCM team can advise on the best systems to examine.</p>

  <p>When you create a stable build you should keep a FCM Make configuration
  file that can reproduce the build. One easy way to do this is to create your
  build using the standard configuration files and the latest versions of the
  code.  You can then save the configuration file which is created on
  success.</p>

  <h2 id="alternate_versions">Maintaining Alternate Versions of Namelists and
  Data Files</h2>

  <p>Sometimes it is useful to be able to access particular revisions of some
  directories from a FCM repository without having to go via Subversion.
  Typical examples are namelist or data files used as inputs to a program. The
  <code>fcm export-items</code> command is designed to help with this. It can
  be used to maintain a set of extracted version directories from a FCM
  repository. The command has the following options:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>--config-file=PATH</code>, <code>--file=PATH</code>, <code>-f
    PATH</code></dt>

    <dd>Specifies the path to the configuration file.
    (default=<samp>$PWD/fcm-export-items.cfg</samp>)</dd>

    <dt><code>--directory=PATH</code>, <code>-C PATH</code></dt>

    <dd>Specifies the path to the destination. (default=<samp>$PWD</samp>)</dd>

    <dt><code>--new</code></dt>

    <dd>Specifies the new mode. In this mode, everything is re-exported.
    Otherwise, the system runs in incremental mode, in which the version
    directories are only updated if they do not already exist.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>The 1st argument SOURCE should be the URL of a branch in a Subversion
  repository with the standard FCM layout.</p>

  <p>The configuration file should be in the deprecated FCM 1 configuration
  format. The label in each entry should be a path relative to the source URL.
  If the path ends in <samp>*</samp> then the path is expanded recursively and
  any sub-directories containing regular files are added to the list of relative
  paths to extract. The value may be empty, or it may be a list of space
  separated <em>conditions</em>. Each condition is a conditional operator
  (<code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>,
  <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>) followed by a
  revision number. The command uses the revision log to determine the revisions
  at which the relative path has been updated in the source URL. If these
  revisions also satisfy the conditions set by the user, they will be
  considered in the export.</p>

  <p>Example:</p>
  <pre>
(SHELL PROMPT)$ cat &gt;fcm-export-items.cfg &lt;&lt;EOF
namelists/VerNL_AreaDefinition   &gt;1000 !=1234
namelists/VerNL_GRIBToPPCode     &gt;=600 &lt;3000
namelists/VerNL_StationList      
elements/*                       &gt;1000
EOF
(SHELL PROMPT)$ fcm export-items fcm:ver_tr
</pre>

  <p>N.B.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Each time a sub-directory is revised, the script assigns a sequential
    <em>v</em> number for the item. Each <em>v</em> number for a sub-directory,
    therefore, is associated with a revision number. For each exported
    revision directory, there is a corresponding <em>v</em> number symbolic
    link pointing to it.</li>

    <li>The system also creates a symbolic link <samp>latest</samp> to point to
    the latest exported revision directory.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="work-practice">Defining Working Practices and Policies</h2>

  <p>Some options on working practices and policies are defined in the chapter
  on <a href="working_practices.html">Code Management Working Practices</a>.
  Individual projects should document the approach they have adopted. In
  addition, each project may also need to define its own working practices and
  policies to suit its local need. For example each project may need to
  specify:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Whether changes are allowed directly on the trunk or whether branches
    have to be used in all cases.</li>

    <li>Whether all users are allowed to make changes to the trunk.</li>

    <li>Whether Trac tickets have to be raised for all changes to the
    trunk.</li>

    <li>Whether Trac tickets should be raised for all support queries or
    whether a Trac ticket should only be raised once there is an agreed
    "issue".</li>

    <li>Whether branches should normally be made from the latest code or from a
    stable release.</li>

    <li>Whether a user is allowed to resolve conflicts directly when merging a
    branch into the trunk or whether he/she should merge the trunk into the
    branch and resolve the conflicts in the branch first.</li>

    <li>Whether all code changes to the trunk need to be reviewed.</li>

    <li>What testing is required before changes can be merged to the
    trunk.</li>

    <li>Whether history entries are maintained in source files or whether
    individual source files changes need to be described in the Subversion log
    message.</li>

    <li>Branch deletion policy.</li>

    <li>Whether any files in the project require locking before being
    changed.</li>
  </ul>
